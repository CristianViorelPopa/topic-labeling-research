In my reading today, I came across this phrase: Pardon the mixed metaphor, but you’ve brought a knife to a gun fight. [Link] The (longtime) columnist was saying the person was outmatched.
Charles Mackay, A Glossary of Obscure Words and Phrases in the Writings of Shakspeare and His Contemporaries (1887) has an interesting but rather lengthy entry for "Brown study," parts of which I reproduce (with annotations) below: Brown study.

/ˈəʊbɔɪ/ (oh + boy) I have no direct information, but let's reason this out. The most modern pronunciation, as recorded in current British dictionaries, is /ˈəʊbɔɪ/ (hoe + boy), with the first syllabe being the same as that of oboe (/ˈəʊbəʊ/), apart from the initial h.
The Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language describes the situation as follows (it's mostly concerned with the orthography, however, not the phonology): [T is] elided after s following a stressed vowel: before /l/, especially in the terminal syllable -le, as in castle, nestle, pestle, trestle, wrestle, [...

No. Squatting down generally requires you to have some part of the body which is above the knees when standing erect to be below the knees.
In the phrases "boob tube", "tit puller", "tit spanners", "get on someone's tits" and "tits on a billiard ball", the two words are not readily interchangeable.
A word you might consider, albeit it rather literary, is quotidian: Ordinary or everyday; mundane: his story is an achingly human one, mired in quotidian details ODO Your "stationery, coffee mugs, bags" and the like are quotidian needs.

The sister to a husband becomes the wife's sister-in-law. If the sister in-law was to marry a woman, would she also become the wife's sister-in-law?
For example: Brother to brother: "We are brothers. We are siblings" Son to father: "We are ________. " I do not know of a word in English to express parent-child relations like that other than in terms of one to the other (i.e.
Your brother's wife, no matter what his age, is called a sister-in-law. Your sister's husband is a brother-in-law. As far as I know, there's no specific term if your sibling is a god brother or god sister, other than god sister's husband or god brother's wife.
So basically, my mom recently remarried to a man with one daughter from a previous marriage. Obviously, she's my step-sister.
He is your brother-in-law. There has already been a similar question posted here to which the answer was "sister-in-law", so I'll finish the list here: Your spouse's brother or your sister's husband is your brother-in-law.

The answer to this can be viewed from a logic process. The sibling of a spouse is by relation the brother or sister of the spouse, and by marital assignment the brother or sister - in - law to the spouses marriage partner.
There's no single word for this in English. You can call this person your 'grandmother-in-law' or your spouse's grandmother, but it is not widely understood to mean that.
It is more common to use a more explicit term, such as my niece's husband, possibly because nephew-in-law could be ambiguous - is it your niece's husband, or your spouse's nephew?

I haven't seen someone offer the word anal (or anal-retentive): The term anal-retentive (also anally retentive), commonly abbreviated to anal, is used conversationally to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that the obsession becomes an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person.

Etymonline states: Anal-retentive first attested 1957, in psychological jargon. According to Wikipedia, which does a much more thorough job of explaining than I will, the term comes from the psychological work of Dr.
You are correct. They staged an interview where he pretended to be Sigmund Freud. Given that he doesn't mention a script, it seems that he was considered to be such an expert on Freud that it was felt he could play the part and answer questions as if he, himself, were Freud.
It's Freud. He classified those as 2 of 5 steps in psychological development. ps. If Freud ain't your style then Nabokov probably isn't either...
But stap me if me trusty Chambers doesn't define pillage as "the act of plundering: plunder" and 'plunder' as (among other things) "vi to pillage: n pillage"!

A couple of colleagues and I have been going through some Google NGrams. At first it seems quite conclusive that plundering is a far more sea worthy activity than pillaging, and plundering is certainly the more pirately thing to do: In an actual example: British critic: and quarterly theological review, Volume 16 (pp.

The following are correct. This is his pencil. / This is my pencil. The following are wrong. This pencil is his. / This pencil is mine.
Thus, "Wet Floor" is a better caution than "Slippery Floor". "Wet Floor" is easier to translate into other languages than "Slippery Floor".
I have the tendency to equate "mine" as something like "hers" and "his". But I am not sure if this is correct. Which is correct?

However, no French speaker thinks of it that way — it's just the way to say "please". ) A "pure" English alternative might be, "The favor of your reply is appreciated."

Atom is a countable noun. Hydrogen is a mass noun. Hydrogen does not have the same meaning as hydrogen atom. Hydrogen atom is another way to say atom of hydrogen (just like ice cube is another way to say cube of ice).
What is the type (adjective, noun, etc. ) of the word atom in hydrogen atom? I think that atom here does not qualify hydrogen in any way and we can use it or not, and the meaning of the word hydrogen will not change.

To be clearer, state the relationship between "crime in X" and "causal chain" in your caption, and use a full sentence.
OK then -- following your clarifications, I suggest these possibilities: Figure 14. (As a typical example of such a chain) Figure 14.

I assume you're talking about the passage at http://plato. stanford. Obviously, the exact extent of the 'inviolate personality' versus the 'public personality' is something rather vague, and a lot of time is spent in courts and governments concerning the protection of these privacies.
But what's the exact meaning of sphere here? And what's the pattern for the use of this kind of sphere? Reading a journal article, I encountered these terms: customer sphere of privacy customer sphere of security privacy sphere of implementation security sphere of implementation I know the rough meaning is: privacy connected with the customer, and so on.

It isn't a very common usage but it would technically be grammatically correct. Here are my two. Where are your crayons?
I think "time zone" is most common. 6 million results, but timezone -"time zone" gives only 6. 3 million. Google backs me up in this case - googling "time zone" -timezone (that is, websites with only time zone in them) gives 12.

There seem to be three spellings: timezone, time-zone, and time zone. [^2] At the same time, timezone is the favored spelling in the US (unless talking about multiple time zones).
I can suggest nerds or eggheads (some might consider this impolite though). and literati [ˌlɪtəˈrɑːtiː]: literary or scholarly people

I know this is true for German and Spanish: Morgen morgen and Mañana por la mañana both mean "tomorrow morning". There may well be other examples too.

So: "... " or "... " This is not the most common usage for recte, but I think it would convey the message. The conventional way is the following: "...
Based on a parallel with my children's use of "jinx" I would propose: ... It might not be correct, but it is at least extensible :-) ...
A discussion of adjective ordering is the right approach here I think, but... To me, “local crumbed scallops” would be already-crumbed scallops obtained locally; “crumbed local scallops” would be scallops obtained locally and then crumbed after being obtained.

To me, Linux-dependent does not sound quite right. Instead, I would say Linux-only software. For example GNOME Discusses Becoming a Linux-only Project The word dependency makes me think of a required library but a platform or OS is more than that.
I think the fellatio notion is quite clear: Suck: Meaning "do fellatio" is first recorded 1928. Slang sense of "be contemptible" first attested 1971 (the underlying notion is of fellatio).

I don't quite understand how one should use the expression "exported from somewhere". What does it mean when an item is exported from a given place?
According to http://www. thefreedictionary. I agree, it does sound better; but, naturally, disable is used as a verb. Hence "disable time" suggests that a subject is trying to disable time (whatever that means).
If you are asking about the sentence Does this also mean that if exports increase and nothing happens to imports, will that lead to Net Exports increasing?

Surely the discussion here is not about what is correct, it is just labeling. Soured Cream simply means it has been soured (made sour), past tense.
Looking at the Corpus of Contemporary American English, I notice that the most used phrase is sour cream. Looking at the entry for sour (the verb) in the NOAD, I find the following definition: make or become sour: [with object]: water soured with tamarind | (as adjective soured): soured cream | [without object]: a bowl of milk was souring in the sun.
Ok, if I say "this car is too expensive" or "this car is very expensive", then I can not express the connotation of "expensive".
Emit and radiate are both good candidates, Emit (v): to throw or give off or out (as light or heat) Radiate (v): to send out in or as if in rays while emanate could be used to describe what the heat itself is doing (although it is sometimes used incorrectly to mean emit.

As a New Englander, I have never heard it called "soured cream". According to Google ngrams, "sour cream" is FAR more popular, but this result indicates that it was originally "soured cream" (not sure how reliable it is).
Personally, I have never heard it used. There are 39. 6 million for soured cream. If we change the Google Ngram to British English, soured cream's popularity increases, so I assume that this is mainly a British expression.
Edit: I'm adding three more examples with "as". The same question as above. (D) My system is expensive, as yours would be.

The most common ways I've seen are writing out the words: sad trombone :( trombone Or to use the onomatopoeic Wah, Wah, Wah, Wahhhhhhh … Womp, Womp, Womp, Wommmmmp… (at the behest of several commenters) Or to combine them: sad trombone: wah, wah, wah, wahhhhh …

We have a word for telling something that is not truthful, a.k.a. to lie, but why is there no conjugatable term for telling the truth?
Is a question that starts with "What need is there to" grammatically correct? If so, is there a difference in meaning or nuance between that clause and "Is there a need to"?

What is the best way to end an informal sentence (such as a text or over Facebook chat) with haha? My only thought was perhaps 'haha' itself could be considered punctuation.
Is there any word/phrase particularly for when one tells others something one incorrectly believes to be false, that is, when one intends to lie but what one tells is, unbeknownst to her, in fact true?

I believe the term you are looking for is petitio principii Petitio Principii: (circular reasoning, circular argument, begging the question) in general, the fallacy of assuming as a premiss a statement which has the same meaning as the conclusion.
It can signify a number of things. You might be disappointed by what you hear: not being supported, not being complimented, not getting an answer, etc.

With the slightest bit of context, I think these would be understood unambiguously. For the owner, use "renting out", and be definite ("my apartment"): I am renting out my apartment in New York.
But if a house was divided up into units, they would each be considered apartments. Condo, which is short for condominium, is mostly the subset of apartments where the individual living units are owned by different people.

What is the plural form of “iPad 2”? When can an adjective be postposed? I'm curious particularly with iPod Touch and iPad Mini The plural would be iPod Touches and iPad Minis, or iPods Touch and iPads Mini
If you are a tenant, you would be "renting" an apartment. If you are a landlord, you would be "letting" an apartment. Sometimes landlords will use the word "rent.
I am confused about the usage of the words like and unlike in sentences. Like and unlike make me confused because I see them being used everywhere almost interchangeably, and to make matters worse I even saw commas making difference in meaning.
The Merriam-Webster entry for "odor" contains: a. a quality of something that stimulates the olfactory organ : scent b.
As a renter I usually think of the tenant as renting, but the dictionaries seem to disagree with me as to primary use. If you are the landlord, you could say I am renting out an apartment in New York.

Consider the following widely-accepted plural forms of popular Apple products whose names consist of two nouns: Macbook Pros iPod Shuffles iPhone 4s Mac Minis Macbook Airs Just as one wouldn't say Macbooks Pro, so also one shouldn't say iPods Touch.

Hoo boy. Which is as far as I can get without knowing more about what the heck a nonrecourse debt is, and what does it mean to be subject to it.
I've just found BrE sneak/sneaked/sneaked and AmE sneak/snuck/snuck. Are there more of these deviations? Generally, lists of irregular verbs in grammars are so poor that they show only half of what there is to know.

Quite simply "not in excess". Since excess means: An amount of something that is more than necessary, permitted, or desirable: and in excess means: Exceeding the proper amount or degree (from ODO) So if something is in excess then it is more than sufficient.
Modern English has changed the way we say "sneak". Nowadays, the word "snuck" is used in many phrases and books. Which one is the correct verb to use in this phrase?
First, I am assuming this is a definition of a type of debt or an explanation of a value. Ok. X is: the FMV of the property subject to Y Y is: the nonrecourse debt to the extent [that] Z is forgiven.

There's no consensus, but The Collective Nouns Page gives us a souffle of clouds. All Sorts has: a pageant of clouds a sky of clouds a storm of clouds a fuck of clouds a cumulonimbus of clouds a menagerie of clouds a cling of clouds Answers.
Both anus and annulus comes from Latin, where anus meant "a ring," and annulus meant "a little ring. " The Latin annulus is derived from the Latin word anus.
Here is the text http://www. shakespeare-navigators. com/othello/T33. html#sd329 and nicely enough here is the explanation http://www.
I think you want Crumbly, meaning that the [cookies] are highly likely to crumble (produce crumbs). If you'd prefer something unrelated to "crumbs", you could use Fragile, but while appropriate it doesn't work nearly as well.
Its plural forms are viruses or vira, and viri and virii are proscribed. Note: from that page, viri exists in Latin but is the nominative plural of vir which means man.

hope you can help me. I am not sure what should I use (or what is actually correct to use). I want to say that "I am sending stuff from one place to another" and at the same time "I am receiving stuff from other places to one specific place".

I disagree with @baquiano to some extent. So in that respect it differs from cargo. For one thing, shipment can also refer to the goods themselves, as in The shipment of machine parts was due to arrive yesterday.
Your sentence is This is a ship-shipping ship, shipping shipping ships. The last shipping is an adjective, describing what kind of ships are being shipped.
The sentence as you use it pertains a little different meaning than the alternatives. It is perfectly OK to say The rows should be copied.

You appear to be considering the two verbs to form a single action, and yet they are two separate operations that can be performed upon the subject (rows).
I'm not sure what the objection to using saucy is all about. Sure, the word has other meanings, but most words have multiple meanings.
In many cases these terms may be used interchangeably. A shipment is generally referred to as a collection of goods which at some point will be, are currently, or have already been moved from one geographical location to another.
I would prefer "pasted" over "copied": I pasted it into the document. Pasting implies that the object of the paste was previously copied, while it is entirely possible to copy something and never do anything else with it.

Source: Dictionary. com What you gave me is a paucity! smallness or insufficiency of number; fewness. I think this word would be perfectly appropriate here, although it's a noun: Paucity [paw-si-tee] / noun smallness of quantity; scarcity; scantiness: a country with a paucity of resources.
You have probably already checked the dictionary for definitions of paucity, scarcity, and dearth. They all basically mean "a lack of something," and the fact that each definition references the others attests to their interchangeable utility.
While in a conversation about a place xyz which is facing water scarcity, if another place abc is also having water scarcity, which sentence would be correct:- I know xyz has water scarcity, but is abc too having water scarcity?

All existing English words having both -less and -ness endings are of the XXXlessness sort; there are none of the *XXXnessless variety.
For Hofstadter fans, this has the bonus of being self-referential. My suggestion is nom d'etre. Your sentence would be: This new development is crying out for a nom d'etre.

Suffixes -ness and -ity are roughly synonymous, but they have different etymologies. There are two roughly synonymous suffixes, -ness and -ity, which are typically used for forming abstract nouns from adjectives, as in example below.

I don't know the way you intend to use the word "energyless-ness", but here are some words:-- powerlessness, inactivity, inertness, stagnancy, sluggishness, listlessness, stationariness, stillness, motionlessness, lethargy...
I can't think of a general term, but the prefix anti could be used with the original product's name/effect to form an adjective.

It is my understanding that, within the aerospace industry, "on orbit" means "in the correct orbit" (such as "on target" or "on path").
Earth is capitalized when it's a name (proper noun of our planet), and not when it's a noun (referring to a planet, its soil, its land...

The premise is flawed, in my view. The package sells "cheapest" would be more correctly stated as "sells most cheaply" or "the package is the cheapest".
I would say this sentence is incorrect because it implies cause and effect. It implies that the earth moves in a particular way in order that it may orbit the sun.

In British English negative questions with the verb have (when it's a lexical verb and not an auxiliary) can be formed in two ways.
primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, denary, duodenary, etc. Currently I'm considering replacing word_or_phrase with higher-order, higher-tier or n-ary, with the intended meaning of "from tertiary onwards".
Here is something I was able to discover on the internet the prime time I confronted the same predicament as you. These come from the Latin roots.
What are the rules (if any) to form the adjective meaning n-ary (in group of n)? When referring to numbers between 0 and 10, the -ary adjectives are: 0 - nullary 1 - unary 2 - binary 3 - ternary 4 - quaternary 5 - quinary 6 - senary 7 - septenary 8 - octonary or octary 9 - novenary or nonary 10 - decenery or denary Can this sequence be continued?
any of the numbers that express amount, as one, two, three, etc. Naturally, in the right contexts, these have been shorted to "cardinals" and "ordinals", i.e.

Common Digits Although it was not always this way, at one point in the history of the Unicode Standard, they made explicit that a digit was only usable for a base-10 numeric character used to compose big-endian numbers.
No, an emoticon is a symbol, not punctuation. Unicode clearly differentiates symbols such as math symbols and currency symbols, from punctuation, such as open or close punctuation.
Obviously the word "sign" is countable noun in this context. One sign. Two signs. But NO SIGN means zero sign. I'd like to say: The calm, balmy evening air showed no sign of the carnage that would ensue.

A rave-up still has some use but it's most common, since around the 1990s, to simply say a rave. Rave-up is somewhat dated, and dates to 1967.

"spew vitriol" is a metaphor; vitriol is a liquid acid, so "spewing" it makes sense: to "spew" means to vomit or spit forth a large amount of liquid.
e.g. The context was personA: Live slugs! personB: Waive off! Waive off! This is just a practice run! I understand that when you waive something you forego it or give it up.
Spewing vitriol is a rather extreme form of expression. "Spewing vitriol" is concise. In contrast, I'd say that ... It carries slightly less weight, which is what you asked about.
They do not mean the same (to finally answer the original question). The question is confusing since both the odd's bodkins and bare bodkin appear in Shakespeare's Hamlet.

How about "begrudging toleration"? "Toleration" already implies that there is something negative (them being Jewish in your example) that you have to accept for whatever reason (you don't like them but the authority tells you to; you don't like them but they have something you want; c.).
"waiver" comes to my mind. I presume you mean "claim" in a legal sense. " Verb: to waive: "to refrain from claiming or insisting on"
So of late I've been hearing a lot of people call other people (or their actions) milk toast. not a word. In looking up milktoast, I found milk-toast.

05 seconds). Ordinal numbers: 100th = one hundredth... 200th = two hundredth... Fractions: 1/100 = one one-hundredth...
Since the numbers in phone numbers are grouped, it's more clear to the listener if you say them in the same groups with an optional pause between the last pairs of digits.
To me, "five hundredth" means 1/500 or 0. 002. But I've seen people use it to mean 0. 05 in sports (e.g. I think 0. 05 should really be "five one-hundredth".
This is a matter of personal preference and/or a style guide, but here's what I recall from one usage authority (The Right Word at the Right Time, published by the Reader's Digest).
What you need to think about here is what it is that there are five of. If you look at a sentence like five cans of paint for example, there are five cans.

If corpus evidence is anything to go by, then Santa Claus is more popular than Father Christmas in the US, and Father Christmas is more popular than Santa Claus in the UK, but by a very much smaller degree.
Santa Claus is a man, right? In this case, he may not be fine with the fact that people call him Santa, which is the Spanish and Portuguese word for female saint names.
When it comes to cities and boats named after saints, it seems that "Santa" is always female and "San" is always male. e.g.
Is the name Father Christmas used in the US or is it mainly Santa Claus (and Santa)? Does Father Christmas sound unusual or out of place if it was used in the US?

I'm not a native English speaker, but I would like to know how and why people started using mother fucker. I know we see it in the movies sometimes, but did people call each other mother fuckers 100 years ago?
Replace "level" with "ability" or "skill" (which is what levels simulate in RPGs), and it doesn't seem at all remarkable to me.
Questions having to do with English words related to Christmas, the yule-log, Santa Claus and the missus, Caroling Caroling Now We Go, Rudolf the Cherry-Nosed Caribou, Dashing Through the Snow, and the North Pole.

But it it feels like it depends too heavily on the initial clause. Also, the final clause is the conclusion of the whole sentence.

I am confused about the meaning of "use of internet" and "internet usage". Is there any difference between these two phrases?
This is mainly a response to Noldorin's answer; I don't have enough reputation points to comment directly. com agrees: "An ellipse always has two axes of reflection; an oval has one or more.
I have a bigger issue with this sentence. When did VPN become a verb? " I believe all of these should be essentially equally correct.
This is adapted from my answer to another question. In my experience, "ellipse" usually has a precise, geometric meaning, while "oval" is a more vague and general term.
"Car window" is a type of window; that which would be part of a car. "Car's window" generally means the window of a particular car.

"The" refers to a specific instance or sample of quinine bark. If you were in the lab and saw a pile of quinine bark you might say to a colleague "I'm going to run a test on the quinine bark," but to the rest of the world there is just quinine bark in general, which is (presumably) what the research hinges on.
How about ‘server address’? You could somewhere early in the document define that ‘server address’ denotes the concatenation ‘servername-hostname-port’ and then always refer to it as ‘server address’.

Demure can function this way. It can mean actually modest, or affectedly modest. And the ambiguity can be handy. 1 : RESERVED, MODEST 2 : affectedly modest, reserved, or serious : COY https://www.

Its called a Trap. Trap house can be a house or club or building that hosts delinquents or druggies. Also make and sell drugs from these traps.
If "an unsprung trap" can mean "a trap not fitted with springs" and also "a trap which has not activated", then generally the second would be the more pertinent information and the more likely meaning, unless you're having a discussion with a trap maker, in which case, well, sometimes things are just ambiguous.
If you really have to say it so directly you could, depending on the context, say 'mind your own beeswax', the word 'beeswax' was apparently slang for a bore back in the 19th Century.

What would it mean for writing to be "crenelated"? From this review: Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ...

Are both It's ideal for you and It's ideal for yourselves grammatically correct? If not, why certain persons use 'you' while other ones use 'yourselves'?
Which is correct, you and I or you and me? It is they who lied or it is them who lied? Which one is grammatically correct: It was me who called you.
More clear vs Clearer, when to use more instead of -er Which of these two terms is correct? If they are both correct, are they identical in usage and meaning, or is one of the words more appropriate for some usages than the other?

Which is correct, you and I or you and me? since "All I need is I" seems not proper here whereas "All I need is you" does.
What does it refer to in its raining? Whence the it in I like it here? What is the grammatical term for the 'it' in forms such as "It is raining" or "It won't matter", and is there a difference between the usage in those two examples?
or You can contact John, Jane or myself for more information ... When is it correct to use yourself and myself (versus you and me)?

Use microblog. Here are the various verbs out there that Twitter competitors and users are actually using and therefore would be meaningful.
Microblog is the only verb that refers specifically to short public postings to social networking services like Twitter.
Consider this text: JavaScript contains weird parts and some people like the idea of being able to avoid having to understand those parts.
As the others have said, there is nothing ungrammatical about the construction. I found it perfectly clear, although it does require a little mental gymnastics to keep the sense clear.

Just a historical note on what is an old question that has burbled back into activity. My understanding was that "tumblelog" was the original term for posting short messages on a social media platform.
Your grammar is fine, and the sentence was perfectly understandable to me, even before you provided more context. I admit that it is a bit convoluted, though, so many readers would have to stop and re-read the sentence before they could make sense of it.
The two-sentence rewrite Nexisa resolved not to give up until she had achieved her dreams. Her determination was stronger than ever.
There are a couple of idioms which cover the basic idea that everyone's needs or wants are not identical: Horses for courses To each his own The adjectives/adjectival phrases custom, customized, fitted, tailor-made, individually made, configurable and unique-fit also exist.

He opposes the use of drugs. He discourages against the use of drugs. He is critical of those who use drugs. He is an advocate of the War on Drugs.
To summarize: Urban dictionary is not very reliable. specifically, the example there of implying reverse psychology, is not defining, but rather a very incidental use.
Drug A is administered concurrently with or sequentially to Drug B. I want to say in a formal manner that Drug A and Drug B are administered either at the same time or at different times, but I don’t want to say whether A or B comes first.
I googled "Gravy Etymology" and found this link which says that "gravy is a subset of sauces made from meat essence" and it goes on to say that Italian-Americans use the word to refer to tomato-and-meat sauce.
[Gravy] is an Italian American invention. I also found at Serious Eats, Sunday gravy: anyone have a great recipe for it?

Here you can see asparagine and aspartic acid as example: Asparagine (Asn) Aspartic acid (Asp) Aspartic and glutamic acid include a carboxylic acid (-COOH), whereas asparagine and glutamine are carboxamides (-CO-NH2).
The same is true for amination. Exceptions do exist, of course. For example, Not all transaminations involve glutamate/glutamine (as this user has replied), and serine and threonine can be directly deaminated (via dehydratase enzymes, as opposed to the dehydrogenase used for glutamate).
Even the GABA aminotransferase employs glutamate/α-ketoglutarate. It seems that all transaminases use glutamate/α-ketoglutarate; in fact most of them do.

-) at neutral pH. +). You are not correct that the groups are truly neutral. The carboxyl group is negatively charged in a solution much higher than the pKa of the carboxyl group (which is pH 2.
Amino acids with non‐ionizable side chains are zwitterions when they are at physiological pH, pH 7.4. This is what my book says.
When exposed to acid, these groups would hydrolyse, releasing ammonia. This method, however, fails to distinguish asparagine/aspartate and glutamine/glutamate due to their acid-unstable nature.
In dogs,eumelanin consists of molecules of DHI and DHICA. DHI and DHICA are made from dopachrome. When TYRP1 has a mutation through which it loses its function, mostly DHI is produced which gives brown eumelanin.

Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, "together", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, "sensation") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.

Looks like I solved it by using PICARD: extracting the aligned reads but without sorting, I used java -jar picard. jar SamToFastq I=file_alnMAP.
This script, named blast2table. pl is from the code accompanying the Blast book by Korf  Yandell (there is a 3rd author whom I haven't met).
fa reads. fastq | samtools sort -o output. bam - Optionally using multiple threads: bwa mem -t 8 genome. fa reads. fastq | samtools sort -@8 -o output.
As a fuller explanation, use bedtools with the intersect command: bedtools intersect -u -a variantList. vcf -b exonicRegions.
Found the solution. You just need to pipe the output from bwa mem into samtools view like so bwa mem ref. fa in. fq | samtools view -bS -  out.

I think Dawkins answers this in the book as well. The point was that most strategies are not stable because the "random" introduction/mutation/evolution of some alternate strategies will disrupt a population of the first strategy.

What mechanisms best explain this increase in fertility of odd ploidy and viability of aneuploids as ploidy levels increase?
The genus Rhododendron has been divided into some 900 plus species. Often these species hybridize in nature creating what are called hybrid swarms.
Depending on the species the hability of generating hybrids will be different. Some can, others don't. I don't know specifically on the Orchids though.

More often than not selection acts at the phenotypic level, and dominance refers to the phenotype. However, when we talk about genotypic fitness ($W$), without any information about the phenotype that each genotype produce, we disregard phenotypic quantity and look at phenotypic quality (fitness).

4kb and 1. The analytical digestion used Promega EcoRI and BamHI in Buffer Multi-Core, which Promega claims offers 75-100% efficiency for both enzymes.
the same location ? What would you do if you want to remove an EcoRI restriction site and introduce BamHI restriction site at apprx.
I would go with BamH1 enzyme as the cut site in pBr322 is BamHI 375 and ss you are plating it in a ampicillin plate you need the ampicillin resistant gene to be intact for screening so by using BamHI you will not disrupt the Amp resistant gene
Eco Since there are only two, order doesn't matter. 0 were adjacent to the 2. Eco Again, if the 4. Bam ??? 0 - Bam ??? 5 - Eco - 1.

Actually what we call "lip" is "vermilion" in medical terminology. But I want to ask if my understanding is right or not regarding to surface anatomy of the lip.
Two raised vertical columns of tissue form a midline depression called the philtrum. The labiomental crease passes horizontally in an inverted U-shape across the lower lip, which intraorally corresponds to the depth of the gingivolabial sulcus.

Sleep-walking is a mixture of NREM and wakefulness. Mahowald, M. W. ,  Schenck, C. H. (2005). Nature, 437(7063), 1279–85.
And how it is raised again during the latter stages of sleep? There is an arousal threshold during sleep that only when it is overcome will it wake a person up.
And these different stages may play different roles in 'rejuvenating' the body (as you put it). Interesting note: There are people who have tried a method called polyphasic sleep, where they nap/sleep periodically and regularly, instead of sleeping once a day for 8 hours, say.
Keep in mind that colder enviromental tempratures significantly attenuated METH-induced neurotoxicity Could the reason as to why 7-NI prevents METH induced neurotoxicity and dopamine depletion simply be because it oxidizes dopamine oxidizer peroxynitrite noting that non-meth induced hyperthermia also cause neurotoxicity and produces peroxynitrite while showing the same neurotoxicity markers as METH induced neurotoxicity such as nitrotyrosine?
It's an interesting phenomenon, but since it isn't dangerous or important clinically, I don't expect it gets much funding.

Most pharmacists (all that I've encountered) tell you that antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of birth control. However, most health organization websites (Planned Parenthood, Mayo Clinic, NHS) explicitly state that ONLY two antibiotics have been shown to sometimes decrease the effectiveness of birth control-- Rifampicin and Rifabutin.
I too had difficulty finding any textbooks or notes that focused solely on genetic engineering. However, after some rather intense looking, I did come across several textbooks that may be helpful.
The lac operon contains genes which are important for the metabolization of lactose as an energy source - normally glucose is used for this purpose.

Preamble. This would just obscure the actual important physical aspects of the sensory input values. Other meerkats immediately hide when hearing this signal (interestingly, this call is mimicked by Drongos who steal the meerkat food that is abandoned in the panic) before checking if a predator is present.

why it does not decrease during its course through axon. For detail about it, refer to the all or none law of nerve impulse which states: The all-or-none law is the principle that the strength by which a nerve or muscle fiber responds to a stimulus is independent of the strength of the stimulus.
Neuroendocrine systems can be defined as the sets of neurons, glands and non-endocrine tissues, and the neurochemicals, hormones, and humoral signals they produce and receive, that function in an integrated manner to collectively regulate a physiological or behavioral state.

This question appears to have a revived interest? I would like to clarify this QA you don't mind. HF(aq), like other hydrogen halides, does completely give up its proton to $\ce{H2O}$ but since F is the most eletronegative element on earth, it will pair up with hydronium ion in the aqueous environment, making the proton "less available", at least to a pH electrode.

Preamble. Examples that contradict this hypothesis: Gorillas have no natural predators or prey but have a very similar sensory setup to ours that helps social bonds.
Perhaps someone can give you an example sound file and/or a spectrogram representation of it. Copied from my comment: It just means a sound that starts at a low frequency and goes up to a higher frequency like a whistle sound.

No it isn't necessary to breathe in CO2 from the atmosphere. No outside CO2 is needed. Your kidneys also play a similar role but the lungs are what provide a rapid response.

I was doing some more research and stumbled upon this paper here by Dr. Izhikevich that describe neurons as a system that can exhibit resonance.
The regulation of metabolites and signals in general (glucose (Glc) or FFA in this case) and their selective uptake by cells, depends on the number (from few hundreds to many thousands) of receptors expressed and displayed to the surrounding environment, the type of receptors (what they can bind, and do as a result) and their properties.
I've been reading up a bit on the CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene manipulation. From what I read, it introduces double-strand breaks at specific points determined by the choice of sgRNA.

In Stathos and Fishman (2014), the authors refer to the concept of structural underdominance. The first time they mention it is in the first paragraph of the second page (left column) and the term is followed by some kind of definition in parenthesis.
In the vertical plane, bending of the fingers is indeed referred to as flexion, while straightening is called extension.
119). This can then lead to unbalanced gametes with low viability, which means low fitness compared to homozygotes. If I have understood the process correctly, chromosomal doubling should lead to better pairing of chromosomes and lower risk of unbalanced chromosome translocations.
What does genetic variance mean in (A)? does it imply that environmental factors are at play Yes and other things. For more information, have a look at Why is a heritability coefficient not an index of how “genetic” something is?

No it isn't necessary to breathe in CO2 from the atmosphere. No outside CO2 is needed. For the buffer system your brain detects the amount of CO2 (H+ which is an indicator of excess or too little CO2) and adjusts your breathing automatically to compensate so that your blood's pH stays normal.
Preamble. This would just obscure the actual important physical aspects of the sensory input values. Other meerkats immediately hide when hearing this signal (interestingly, this call is mimicked by Drongos who steal the meerkat food that is abandoned in the panic) before checking if a predator is present.
I guess, we are talking about mammals here (because in other organisms leveling up of expression on sex chromosomes happens differently: e.g.

Ventricular diastole is a period in cardiac cycle during which the ventricles are filling with blood. During this period, the atria are contracting and the ventricles are relaxed.
So, when we say that our blood pressure is 180mmhg, it's wrong. In reality, the blood pressure is (180+760)mmHg inside the blood vessel, and our blood pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure by 180mmhg.

The mechanism given by the OP is renowned in the world of pharmacology and drug-receptor interactions, and is due to Castillo and Katz (1957).
I think the OP is asking the following: If an enzyme is not specific one substrate, but is simultaneously presented with a pair of substrates, which one 'wins' and how do we decide?

Note: The term equilibrium is different from steady-state w.r. t chemical reactions. Steady state is the right term for the above example.
No. But a strong correlation may nevertheless be an indicator for heritability (it makes it more likely). The reason is, that the correlation in the phenotype (birth weight) is not only due a correlation in the genotype but also a correlation in the environment of the child and its mother (culture, economical situation, genes, etc of their respective mothers).

In general Analytic solutions only exist for special cases. Therefore a good way of approaching these problems is to first act like they don’t and be happy if you can see how to derive one.
If I have for species $x_{i} ,i=1,2,3,4 $ that compete on the same food resource ,could we say that they have common carrying capacity K and write this system or each species shoud have its own carrying capacity anyways \begin{align*} \frac{dx_{1}(t)}{dt}=\quadx_{1}r_{1}\left(1-\frac{\sigma_{11}x_{1}+\sigma_{12}x_{2}+\sigma_{13}x_{3}+\sigma_{14}x_{4}}{K}\right),\quad x_{1}(0)0\\ \frac{dx_{2}(t)}{dt}=\quadx_{2}r_{2}\left(1-\frac{\sigma_{22}x_{2}+\sigma_{21}x_{1}+\sigma_{23}x_{3}+\sigma_{24}x_{4}}{K}\right),\quad x_{2}(0)0\\ \frac{dx_{3}(t)}{dt}=\quadx_{3}r_{3}\left(1-\frac{\sigma_{33}x_{3}+\sigma_{31}x_{1}+\sigma_{32}x_{2}+\sigma_{34}x_{4}}{K}\right),\quad x_{3}(0)0\\ \frac{dx_{4}(t)}{dt}=\quadx_{4}r_{4}\left(1-\frac{\sigma_{44}x_{4}+\sigma_{41}x_{1}+\sigma_{42}x_{2}+\sigma_{43}x_{3}}{K}\right),\quad x_{4}(0)0\\ \end{align*} In the absence of x2,x3,x4 we get $$\frac{dx_{1}(t)}{dt}=x_{1}r_{1}\left(1-\frac{\sigma_{11}x_{1}}{K}\right) =x_{1}r_{1}\left(1-\frac{x_{1}}{\frac{K}\sigma_{11}}\right)=x_{1}r_{1}\left(1-\frac{x_{1}}{K_{1}}\right)$$ $ K_{1}$ : will be the environmental carrying capacity for species x1.

Pangolin scales are certainly not retained from fish. Pangolins are within the clade Pholidota (Tree of Life page for Eutheria) and their nearest relatives are anteaters, sloths, and armadillos.
I have seen about 3 variation of phylogenetic tree about odd-toed ungulate and I don't know which one is really updated or outdated or which one have more backed up theory First is odd-toed ungulate are closest to even-toed ungulate https://en.
So, I suspect things are actually somewhat complicated and the best way to know would be to test in vivo That would suggest that at concentrations significantly below 2.

No it isn't necessary to breathe in CO2 from the atmosphere. For the buffer system your brain detects the amount of CO2 (H+ which is an indicator of excess or too little CO2) and adjusts your breathing automatically to compensate so that your blood's pH stays normal.

This is a Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), which is a heron in its breeding plumage. When not breeding, the bird is white.

What species of crane is this? Today afternoon, I found this crane among a group of white cranes that were moving around a herd of buffaloes.
The body shape does seem to indicate it's some kind of heron/egret (12 species, of which, have been previously found in Michigan [according to Wikipedia]).
They were not in each other's vicinity, so it's not a pair in the sense that they were mates (not that I can tell at least :-).

As such it is more 'loose' than the 'dense' fascia. It lies immediately on the surface of the muscle (epi = on, mysium = muscle) below the fascia.
Epimysium is a layer of connective tissue, which ensheaths the entire muscle. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue.

It was my Viva question and I was really puzzled. I know what is femoral hernia and it route like the abdominal content moves down the femoral canal and further through the saphenous opening and all but I have no idea about it's coverings.
so are they same or different how can we describe it and differentiate it? I have read that epimysium is dense regular connective tissue made covering the a muscle like bicep brachi.
The Fascia Research Society acted to address this issue by establishing a Fascia Nomenclature Committee (FNC) whose purpose was to clarify the terminology relating to fascia.
The other answer by @CMosychuk talks about the general aspect related to use of hypochlorous acid. I will discuss here its molecular mechanism of action.
"The fascial system" The fascial system consists of the three-dimensional continuum of soft, collagen-containing, loose and dense fibrous connective tissues that permeate the body.

This paper addresses the question that you are asking. In this case the action potential is generated in response to the rats' sensory input in the form of a beep.

No it isn't necessary to breathe in CO2 from the atmosphere. For the buffer system your brain detects the amount of CO2 (H+ which is an indicator of excess or too little CO2) and adjusts your breathing automatically to compensate so that your blood's pH stays normal.
The lac operon contains genes which are important for the metabolization of lactose as an energy source - normally glucose is used for this purpose.
Will after looking up more about IPTG online I see it's related to the lac operator, which from what I've found just deals with lactose.
I am interested in learning about GMO. The topic is so wrapped in controversy, that it's hard to find a good book that introduces the basic concepts involved.
Preamble. This would just obscure the actual important physical aspects of the sensory input values. Other meerkats immediately hide when hearing this signal (interestingly, this call is mimicked by Drongos who steal the meerkat food that is abandoned in the panic) before checking if a predator is present.

Possibly Vaccinium gaultherioides (sometimes considered a subspecies of Vaccinium uliginosum), which are present throughout the Alps.
Most pharmacists (all that I've encountered) tell you that antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of birth control. However, most health organization websites (Planned Parenthood, Mayo Clinic, NHS) explicitly state that ONLY two antibiotics have been shown to sometimes decrease the effectiveness of birth control-- Rifampicin and Rifabutin.

Your first question seems to be terminological. (And hence, in this sense, is more "robust" than other rules. But this is just a definition, and anyone is free to modify it as they see fit for their own purposes, as long as they are clear and consistent in their use of terminology.
The hairdresser has bought scissors, shampoo, etc. He may even heat his/her store and supply it with electricity. These are all input to the production on which VAT was paid.
E.g. Therefore these are separate properties. You can argue you need both, but perhaps you are willing to part with one or the other.
First it is important to define our terms. When you ask, "does a disagreement regarding how to weight the voters entail a disagreement regarding aggregation rule?

I am trying to compile a list of winners of the Nobel memorial prize in economics whose thesis advisor also won the prize.

The following is a slight rewording of an example in Richard Thaler's Misbehaving (1): Positive framing of certain outcome Imagine you are $300 richer than you are today.
If the utility is continuous and locally insatiable then the Hicksian demand equals the Walrasian demand. So you'll need to look for a utility function which violates atleast one of these.
I believe your questions are: Q1. Definition 4. We interpret $\sim$ as the indifference relation. $x \sim y$ if $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim x$.
Here is another example with two consumers (A and B), two goods (X and Y): \begin{eqnarray*} u_A(x_A, y_A)  =  \min(x_A, y_A), \ \omega_A = (1, 0) \\ u_B(x_B, y_B)  =  \min(x_B, y_B), \ \omega_B = (0, 1) \end{eqnarray*} In this case, every feasible allocation $((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B))$ satisfying $y_A = x_A$ is a competitive equilibrium, and is supported by price vectors $(p_x, p_y) \in \mathbb{R}^2_+$ such that $p_xx_A +p_yy_A = p_x$ holds.

It may be helpful to consider a phenomenon from politics called the Condorcet paradox. This is a situation that can happen in votes, in which the overall population would vote for A over B, would vote for B over C, and would vote for C over A.
No, single-peakedness is not necessary for majority rule to be transitive. For example, "single-dipped" preference profiles (the vertical mirror image of "single-peaked" profiles) also produce transitive majority preferences.
The statement is not true. Let $x_A + x_B = 1$, $y_A + y_B = 1$. Let $U_A(x_A,y_A) = x_A + \ln(y_A)$, $U_B(x_B,y_B) = x_B + \ln(y_B + 1)$.

Yes, there are many. For each $a  0$, we have $(a+1, a) \succ (a, a)$, and therefore, $u(a+1, a)  u(a, a)$. Since $a \in \mathbb{R_{++}}$, there are uncountably many such intervals, but set of rational numbers are countable.

You just need to use the violation of transitivity and proceed by contradiction. (another two reals). Since the reals are transitive, we conclude $u(x_1,y_1)\geq u(x_3,y_3)$ which in turn implies that $(x_1,y_1)R(x_3,y_3)$.
Utility functions and indifference curves are the same object considered from different visual/conceptual angles. Below an illustration on $U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{0.
Car prices haven’t gone up due to the majority of auto makers profits being from the truck and SUV market. Trucks and SUVs have gone up 40% since 2007.
Show that there is no continuous utility function which represents the lexicographic preferences $\mathscr{L}$ given by $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$ if and only if $x_1  y_1$ or $x_1 = y_1$ and $x_2  y_2$.
Your example is (more or less): You can now try and argue what kind of preferences these are. If you are interested in consumer theory, you should find some proper course book or other materials - there's plenty of it on the Internet - just google it.

I would like to ask for your help. Infinitely many thanks for your help! Thus, I would have liked to see a proof of this statement and how is it possible to build such a utility representation.
There are two firs in the market. They produce perfect substitutes at cost $c(y_i)=y_i/3$ for i=1,2. However firm 1 has the opportunity to announce the output it will produce to firm 2 before the firms have produced any output.

Also the regressors should be strictly exogenous, but it's the same for linear FE models. , average partial effects) are not obtainable.
GDP: If I remember correctly, Congressional budget office offers 10-12 yr forward potential gdp every quarter, from which you can derive predicted potential growth.

I have a dataset with mean and median wages for particular geographic areas around the United States. I am interested in calculating the wage premium between some areas.
Are there DSGE models with agents with different skill levels (and according wage differences) who can develop or lose their skills and with employees with dynamic/changing skill levels and skill domains?
Quarterly GDP growth can be calculated either in terms of YoY change or - in the case of seasonally adjusted data - in terms of QoQ change.
The OECD might be quite specific in their terminology. I think the use of QoQ (quarter on quarter) and YoY (year on year) are more commonly used.

1" is false. World Resources Institute: This rate is roughly 2. 1 children per woman. 2. 1 is simply a very crude and made-up figure.
Both of these things can be thought of as Supply/Demand problems where the relevant concept is actually how Demand is decided.

NBA stars create more money (ticket prices, jersey sales, merchandising, branding). But all the doctors earn realitively well.
The economics and public policy website, Crooked Timber, devoted a question entirely to that subject recently. New Old Keynesianism delineates the differences between Old Old Keynesianism, Old New Keynesianism, New Old Keynesianism and New New Keynesianism such that "New" means “post Global Financial Crisis” and “Old” to refers to a belief that the economy can be in a long-run high unemployment equilibrium.
There are many ressources available online Synth is a statistical software that implements synthetic control methods for causal inference in comparative case studies with aggregate data as described in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010), and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2013).

I have read many articles about Bayesian thinking. When math is involved, I find it very difficult to compute the posterior mentally.
I don't see that phrase in the linked PDF, but I don't think these terms are being used in a manner particularly special to economics, and this would probably be better suited to English Language SE.
Let say the electorate consists of three segments of voters: 1, 2, and 3 with corresponding weak preference relations defined over the candidates.
What is the exact difference between a secondary tax adjustment and a corresponding tax adjustment? Are these two adjustment not the same?

As far as i understand in the Krugman target zone model the following equation describes the behaviour of the exchange rate within and outside a target zone $s_t = f_t + \alpha E_t(ds_t/dt)$.
I think your questions are very interesting. We also avoid costs associated with accelerated climate change. Our options for helping those farmers or manufacturers out of work include but are not limited to: incentives to switch to crop farming start-up programs to encourage new land use such as afforestation or sanctuaries incentives for transport, retail, accommodation, or local government to provide training or apprenticeship schemes for those out of work.
Time series on rental price of capital can be estimated using $$r=\frac{P_k}{P}(i-inf+\delta)$$ here, $P_k$ is the price of capital goods (price index for capital goods), $P$ is a deflator, $i$ is nominal interest rate, $inf$ is an inflation rate and $\delta$ is depreciation rate of physical capital stock.
in preparation for our upcoming exam, our tutor has uploaded sample questions. One of them is the following: This is my solution: Which differs from the solution, which gives the ordinary square root of the same parameters, not the 4th-one.
As mentioned by Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green, the equality is true "for all $p$ and $w$". This implies the former equality and also explains why it is not only true for the upscaled new prices and income $(p,w)=(\kappa p_0,\kappa w_0)$ but actually for any prices and income because both $\kappa$ and $(p_0,w_0)$ can be arbitrary.

My textbook describes the GVA at Market Prices as: GVA at Basic Prices + Product Taxes - Product Subsidies. Various sources online refer this same sum (GVA at Basic Prices + Product Taxes - Product Subsidies) as the GDP at Market Prices.
Partly your question relates to more general questions like "buy versus rent a house", or "buy versus lease a machine".
I have learned about the Markov decision process (MDP) formalism in the context of machine learning. I know that micro theorists also study MDP's, and agent behaviour in this context (both single and multi-agent I think).

This is an asset pricing question. Here's the context: The fact that carry trade strategies typically earn positive average returns is a manifestation of the failure of the uncovered interest parity (UIP) hypothesis, a major longstanding puzzle in international finance.

Have I understood this correctly? A reviewer of my paper has asked me to explain in the paper what ex-post and ex-ante means.
I am reading some lecture notes on asset pricing, and they use the term "ex-dividend" price of an asset. I googled and found that ex-dividend means the time between announcement and payment of a dividend.
The conventional definition of Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) is as follows: A pure strategy BNE is a profile of type-contingent strategies $$(s_i(\theta_i),s_{-i}(\theta_{-i}))=(s_1(\theta_1),\dots,s_{i-1}(\theta_{i-1}),s_i(\theta_i),s_{i+1}(\theta_{i+1}),\dots,s_m(\theta_m))$$ such that for each $i\in P$, $$ s_i(\theta_i)\in\arg\max_{s_i'\in S_i} \sum_{\theta_{-i}}p(\theta_{-i}\mid \theta_i) u_i(s_i'(\theta_i),s_{-i}(\theta_{-i}),(\theta_i,\theta_{-i})).
The simplest example I could cook up. I might have messed up somewhere. Consider the provision of a public good with two agents, $n=2$.
Let $BR=(BR_1,BR_2,BR_3,... Let $x_i$ denote $\theta_i - m_i'$, so the equation system $$ \forall i\in N: 0 = \theta_i - m_i' + \gamma \sum_{j \ne i} (\theta_j-m_j') $$ becomes $$ \forall i\in N: 0 = x_i + \gamma \sum_{j \ne i} x_j.

I assume that you found Firm 3's best response to be \begin{equation} q_3^*(q_1,q_2)=\frac12(16-q_1-q_2). \end{equation} The next step would be to solve for Firm 2's best response.
We examine the function $F(K,L)$ that is homogeneous of degree $\lambda  1$. Then we have that its partial derivatives are homogeneous of degree $\lambda -1 $.
Now we can solve for the Nash equilibrium (NE). Profit maximization would yield the following first-order conditions for the two firms: $$ \begin{aligned} p'_1(q_1^*,q_2)q_1^*+p(q_1^*,q_2)-C_1'(q_1^*)=0\qquad\qquad(1)\\ p'_2(q_1,q_2^*)q_2^*+p(q_1,q_2^*)-C_2'(q_2^*)=0\qquad\qquad(2) \end{aligned} $$ These are the usual MR=MC condition (for each firm).
So we want the Hessian to be NSD, so we need the PMs to alternate weakly. $H=\begin{bmatrix} F_{kk}  F_{kl} \\ F_{kl}  F_{ll} \end{bmatrix}~~NSD \iff~~~F_{kk},F_{ll}\leq0~~~\~~F_{kk}F_{ll}-F_{kl}^2\geq0$ We are given that $F_{kk},F_{ll}0$ so we need to figure out the cross partials.
Consider two firms Inverse functions: $p(q)=max\{a-q,0\} $ $q$ is total production and a is positive constant. If need more clarification, I immediately add something.

Start with the second stage, this is just Cournot competition between firm 2 and firm 3. You can solve this for the Nash equilibrium by setting the first order condition for firm 2 and firm 3 and solving these two equations, taking $q_1$ as given.

Consider a game consisting of two players, P1 and P2, played over multiple time steps. Refer to P1 as she and P2 as he.
To continue the example of the street performer: Suppose there are two people offering the performer money, but in exchange they want her to perform different songs.

Could somebody explain how Straffin calculated the security levels for Rose and Colin on p. 103? As far as I understood, Colin's security level is 6 because it is the minimum of the strategy Colin A because Colin A dominates Colin B.
You are right, it is the same thing. Actually, later on the book the density over the history $s^t = [s_t, s_{t-1}, \cdots, s_0]$ is written as $$ \pi(s^t) = \pi(s_t|s_{t-1}) \cdots \pi (s_1|s_0)\pi(s_0) \tag{2.3.
The way I would think of this is as follows. Let us write the value of the first company as $V_{A}$and the second as $V_{B}.
Because you want to measure the real impact of education. If there is inflation, the nominal wages most likely will go up over time, but you don't want to think that your return to education does that, it's just inflation.

3) Just as a curiosity, what it is the reason of including the adjective "correlated"? From reading at p. 2) How does the definition of BCE simplify to when $N=1$?
7 of this paper. Let me summarise the definition provided in the paper. There are $N\in \mathbb{N}$ players, with $i$ denoting a generic player.
I would like your help to use the correct terminology to define a Bayes Correlated Equilibrium (BCE) and a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) in a "game" with one player.
Question 1: Is it correct to say that $S^*$ is at least as informative as $S^1$? Is it correct to say that: $\forall S \in \mathcal{S}$ where $S\equiv ((T_i)_{i=1}^N, \pi)$, there exists a combination $S^*\in \mathcal{S}$ of $\underline{S}$ and $S$ such that $S^*$ and $S$ are informationally equivalent.

I think the reason you're having difficulty is that your definition is actually not equivalent to Bergemann and Morris' definition of BCE, except under specific assumptions which include the ones you state regarding independence.

For the second term, note that it is proportional to the conditional probability of the other players being of type $t_{-i}$ when you are of type $t_i$ since $\pi(t_{-i}|t_i,\theta)=\frac{\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta)}{\sum_{t_{-i}}\pi(t_i,t_{-i}|\theta)}$.
I'll start from your last equation. \begin{align*} \int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{u(\theta) dF(\theta)}  = \Big[ u(\theta)F(\theta) \Big]_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}} - \int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{F(\theta) v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta} \\  = u(\bar{\theta})F(\bar{\theta})-u(\underline{\theta})F(\underline{\theta})-\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{F(\theta) v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta} \\  = u(\bar{\theta})-\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{F(\theta) v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta} \text{ since } F(\bar{\theta})=1, F(\underline{\theta})=0\\  = u(\underline{\theta})+(u(\bar{\theta})-u(\underline{\theta}))-\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{F(\theta) v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta} \\  = u(\underline{\theta})+\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{u'(\theta) d\theta}-\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{F(\theta) v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta} \\  = u(\underline{\theta})+\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta}-\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{F(\theta) v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta} \text{ since } u'=v_{\theta}\\  = u(\underline{\theta})+\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{(1-F(\theta)) v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) d\theta} \\  = u(\underline{\theta})+\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{\dfrac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)} v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) dF(\theta)} \\  = \int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{u(\underline{\theta})dF(\theta)}+\int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{\dfrac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)} v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) dF(\theta)} \\  = \int_{\underline{\theta}}^{\bar{\theta}}{\Big[u(\underline{\theta})+\dfrac{1-F(\theta)}{f(\theta)} v_{\theta}(q(\theta),\theta) \Big]dF(\theta)} \end{align*}
Define a Bayesian game as follows: $$G = \left\langle I, \left(A_i,T_i,(p_{t_i})_{t_i \in T_i}, u_i \right)_{i \in I} \right\rangle$$ $I$ is the set of players $A_i$ is the action set for player $i$, $T_i$ is the set of possible types for player $i$, $p_{t_i} \in \Delta(T_{-i})$ is player $i$'s beliefs regarding the types of the other players.

And on p. " Also, I'm somewhat unsurprised that Stiglitz turns out to be an editor of this journal. 23 What remains unclear is whether the Eurozone authorities are willing and legally entitled to impose EU-related rather than Eurozone-specific hardships on an exiting country.
Unsustainable is a strong word for describing state budgets. For all NJ short comings, they have a massive tax base that actually pays taxes, a responsible and effective legal system, the US FED, non-corrupt politicians (but not effective), New York City, and industry.
Presidential candidate Andrew Yang has published the following policy proposals on his website: 1. The best answers should include an explication of financial transaction tax, examples of what tangible changes the second policy proposal might entail, and an analysis of how impactful all of this could and is likely to be for algorithmic intraday trading.
europa. By the way, by my research, in 2017 the Japanese debt-to-GDP was more like 253%. So stay tuned friend as evidence is accumulating that developed economies such as Japan and in particular, the United States, are on dangerous ground and possibly past the point of no return.
The EU has a harmonized CPI methodology (HICP). ] Methods used for combining prices to give elementary aggregates vary widely among the individual countries of the G-20, the geometric mean (Jevons index) is the method most commonly used (10 countries plus France, Italy and the United Kingdom).

Several points need to be considered. Indeed, different sectors display significantly different productivity and efficiency of the labor factor.
Going by some ECB models/estimates from last year, protectionism would result in negative consequences pretty fast, e.g.
For example, processed food products could face an average increase in tariffs of about 17 percent. In South Africa, the UK is expected to lose about USD\$240 million, equivalent to about 9 percent of its exports to South Africa.
The answer depends on whether you want accuracy with respect to original (national) sources, more comparability, and how much time you want to spend compiling data.

In recent coverage of the Fed's repo operation, I was struck by this line: It also indicated Wall Street is struggling to absorb record sales of Treasury debt to fund a swelling U.S.
This question already has an accepted answer, which addresses the economic drawbacks of rent control quite well. I did want to contribute one additional aspect that hasn't really been addressed: Rent control can be viewed as a form of (limited) compensation to residents/tenants, for their contribution to making their neighborhoods desirable places to live (and thus driving up property values.

I think it will help to fill in some of the missing causal elements in this picture. Therefore this is a sign that the economy will not do well in the future.
Both answers here are giving really good definitions of the concepts, but I think it's important to additionally talk about the relation between the two to clarify the justified confusion and to compare them.
About your second paragraph, the confusion arises from the benchmark that you want to compare. So if you compare the spot rates before and after raising the interest rate, you find that the domestic currency appreciate.
Your questions can be answered when you think in terms of this equilibrium. Suppose your income increases from \$100 a week to \$200 a week.
Which brings us to the first point of confusion... This is not a contradiction as much as a competing factor. I believe that an increase in the demand for real capital means the same thing as the increase in the demand for loanable funds The reduced demand for money increases the supply of loanable funds, which induces more demand, which is then used to purchase real capital.

As a conclusion , if IR decrease in the future, it will make people expect higher return on long term bonds today , since there is more risk.

The surviving probability at period 2 is p. The interest rate is fixed at r. Under what condition she prefers the economy with the PAYG pension?
In Notes on the Theory of Choice (assuming this is what you refer to by "Kreps (1988)"), Kreps does not appear to mention WARP as such.
There is not a ton to go off of with your question, so apologies for the vagueness of my answer: First, since strategies aren’t symmetric, you will find a $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ for respective players.
My Lagrangian is: $L=\sum\limits_{t=0}^T \beta^tU(f(k_t)-k_{t+1})+\sum\limits_{t=0}^T\lambda_t(f(k_t)-k_{t+1}). $ My FOC for $[k_{t+1}]$ is: $\beta^tU'(f(k_t)-k_{t_1}^*)(-1)-\lambda_t^*+\beta^{t+1}U'(f(k_{t+1}^*-k_{t+2})+\lambda^*_{t+1}f'(k_{t+1})^*=0$.
Real life is more complicated than that. For example Companies A and B might be competing in the same market sector, but then collaborate on producing a new product aimed at a particular niche in the market.

Let me begin with noting that models such as the CAPM have been extensively falsified, beginning with Mandelbrot in 1963 and ending with the Fama-MacBeth testing in 1973.
So, for example, when you have performed a t-test, you have assumed that a mean exists and that it is meaningful. Non-parametric methods allow you to perform tests on data without reference to a parameter.
In The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, Gary Becker said: The combined assumptions of maximizing behavior, market equilibrium, and stable preferences, used relentlessly and unflinchingly, form the heart of the economic approach as I see it.
Problem: According to Wulf Gaertner’s (2009, p. ” This makes sense, however, when I looked up the definition of a `strictly increasing function/transformation’ I became confused regarding how this would allow one to represent cases of indifference as well as cases of strict preference.

Your question is a little bit vague, but I'll do my best. \times S_n$, which characterizes all possible strategy combinations for all possible players.
I interpret the question as follows: Suppose we have a finite normal form game (with finitely many players and a finite set of actions for each outcomes).
In the previous stage to the above Player $2$ move stage, Player $1$ must ensure that he makes the sum $19$. $8$, $11-s_j^1$, $11-s_j^2$ is the only way I could think of writing the strategy set.
Consider decision making in an economic model. The second inequality is interpreted similarly. wikipedia. org/wiki/Multinomial_probit).

I assume from this that the $x_i$ are constrained to be non-negative? Using the Lagrange multiplier technique with Lagrangian $L=\sum_i f(x_i)-\lambda (\sum_i x_i-\overline x)$, we can conclude that the stationary points occur when $\frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x}\big{|}_{x_i}=\lambda$.
For simplicity, I've assumed U = 9 in this case but the solution would work for any U > 0. Px/Py  1/3. e, Px/Py > 1/3. x can vary anywhere from 0 to U.
Find the returns to scale for he following production function- $(x_1 + 1)^. The answer given, however, is decreasing returns to scale.
My notes says that if $u(. )$ is strictly quasiconcave and differentiable, by the supporting hyperplane theorem, there exists $p 0$ and $w \geq 0$ such that $ x = x(p,w)$ $\forall x$.

+\alpha_{n}x_{n}$ such that $\alpha_1+... +\alpha_n=1$. But I am quiet confused about why we can write any $L=(p_1,... ,L^n)$.
Without convexity, we'd lose the convenience of using the first order condition (or the tangency condition) to identify the optimal consumption bundle.
Then maximize with respect to $x_1$. This is a problem that has also an inequality constraint, alongside the budget constraint that is here given as an equality.
for this problem you must conciser two possible utility functions: $$u(\text{x})=x_1+x_3\ \ \text{if} \ \ x_1x_2$$ $$u(\text{x})=x_2+x_3\ \ \text{if} \ \ x_1x_2$$ The demands of these then proceed how you would for any case of perfect substitutes.

I am conducting some regressions on economic growth determinants and I am disillusioned. What does this tell about whether the explanatory variables influence economic growth?
One way to think about this utility function is "I can only use one of these two goods, and I will use the one that I have more of" Some examples: Choosing between two sets of equally-valued but non-matching dishware.
Blundell and Costa Dias (2000) (https://onlinelibrary. wiley. com/doi/pdf/10. 1111/j. 1475-5890. 2000. tb00031. x) present in page 448 a generic matching estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated as: $\hat{\tau}^{ATT} = \sum_{i:T_i = 1} \Big( Y_i - \sum_{j: T_j = 0} W_{i,j} \cdot Y_j \Big) \cdot w_i$ where, and I quote, "$W_{i,j}$ is the weight placed on comparison observation j for individual i and i $w_i$ accounts for the reweighting that reconstructs the outcome distribution for the treated sample".

Here's a question about CPI in my microeconomics text (Pindyck), which I don't seem to understand: The price of computers has fallen substantially over the past two decades.
Does it just mean the goods and service are the same but the weights of each good itself do not matter? (Basket of CPI and GDP are also included A and B but no matter weights) .

When reporting regression results I typically have put "robust standard errors in parentheses" below or "cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses" when appropriate.
But in reality, consumption is often done not by an individual but by an household/family. All household members live in the same house, use the same furniture and the same electricity equipment, etc.

Alex consumes only lemons and sugar. For each lemon he requires exactly 2 spoons of sugar. What is Alex's optimal consumption bundle?
Suppose we are estimating a linear model utilizing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique such as a Gibbs sampler, drawing from the posteriors in a Bayes framework.
we need a minimum of 2 sugars initally so we can say $x=2$ for 1 lemon so $y=1$ Plugging those values into our budget constraint: $44=20x+y$ $44=20(2)+(1)$ $4441$ Notice how we end up having 3 left over, however with the budget constraint and preferences provided our consumption bundle will be 2 sugars and 1 lemon.
What is a good reference on this problem? I thought of several options: Calculate an aggregate utility function, e. g: $$ u_F(x,y) = \min_{i\in F} u_i(x,y) $$ Then, calculate the demand in the usual way: select a bundle $(x_F,y_F)$ that maximizes the aggregate utility $u_F$ in the budget-set.
Consider an exchange economy with two goods, e.g. home furniture (x) and electrical equipment (y). There are two families.

I think any (and none) of your answers is correct. More generally speaking, if purchase decisions are made via some game, then you have to solve the game first in order to obtain the demand functions.

Suppose I have a set of units $n_i, i = 1,... ,N$. One unit was receiving a treatment $n_j = 1$ at times $t=1$ to $t=\tau$.
I have just read the concept of both Net Present Worth (NPW) and the External Rate of Return (ERR). I may have understood wrong, please correct me if I am wrong.
Let $c = 0$ and $Q_k = \sum_{i = 1}^k{q_i}$. For $j = n$ the best response is given by \begin{align} b_n(Q_{n-1}) = \arg\max_{q_n}(1 - Q_{n-1} - q_n)q_n = \frac{1- Q_{n-1}}{2}.

I was carefully rereading the underlying paper (Bloch, 1996) and found what I was looking for. Let $N = \{1,\ldots,n\}$ denote the set of agents and let $\Pi_{\{1, \ldots, i-1\}}$ denote the set of coalition structures of $\{1, \ldots, i-1\}$ for all $i \in \{2,\ldots,n\}$.
I got stock with this problem for days. The fact is that in a statical analysis, increasing $Q_K$ reduces consumption. But in a dynamic analysis, increasing $Q_K$ means more capital is saved and hence next year an higher production function that allows for more consumption than today, hence, a positive growth rate of consumption.
This is a complement/comment to Alecos' answer, who said that Note that the requirement that the probabilities are Uniform, impose the condition that, if we want to have proper distributions, the number of urns must be finite Denote the total size of the world as $N$.
Investment protects are inherently risky, and when calculating either of these numbers many assumptions need to be made.

I'm wondering how to interpret Okun’s coefficient. Say you have $y^c = -1*u^c$. The “-2” regime therefore looks more contractionary.
What I'm reading seems to suggest that the price of the subsidiary's stock will converge to that of its parent, but I'm not sure why.
If you multiply out any one of the equations, $$w_{clothes}= \beta _ {clothes} + \alpha_{clothes} \cdot \ kids + (\gamma _{0.
I have the following demand equation system (expenditure ratio model): $w_{clothes}= \beta _ {clothes} + \alpha_{clothes} * \ kids + (\gamma _{0.

If such subsidiaries bypass the restrictions, what is the remaining purpose of FTAs? Or something else? One of the ways corporations trade transnationally in the face of local restrictions on market access is to set up subsidiary companies or regional offices from which trade is conducted.
I cannot comment on the benefits/limitations of this though. Moreover, these accounts were necessary as we had to deal with transactions involving various currencies.
Is the real wage counter or pro- cyclical? I've read in some textbooks that the real wage is mildly pro-cyclical, but I've also found some papers stating that it's acyclical.

Though behavioural economics has been popularized over the past decade in both industry and pop culture, it seems that not much has changed with regard to the standard economic definition of rationality.
Here's another way, using the same notation as Adam, to get to the same result: $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = P(\text{searching twice | being matched})\cdot P(\text{another match | searching twice}) $$ Now, $$P(\text{searching twice | being matched}) = \frac{P(\text{searching twice and being matched})}{P(\text{being matched})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s} $$ $$P(\text{another match | searching twice}) = \frac{P(\text{another match and searching twice})}{P(\text{searching twice})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} $$ So, $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s}\frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} = \frac{2\psi_u\nu}{(1+\psi_u)}$$

Short answer Perhaps your concern about stimulating demand is explained by the broken window fallacy. We do not need robots to stimulate demand of rival goods.
The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem implies that, in every non-dictatorial voting system with 3 or more candidates, there is a preference profile in which some of the voters can gain by lying about their preferences.
Intuition Well, when $r$ is zero, you are just getting value $A$ per time unit, so total present value will be $A \cdot t$.
The first / second seller terminology can be confusing here (does it relate to time or to conditionality?). It's safer to focus on a particular seller.

Assume that there are $m$ different types of aircrafts. If $A,B\subset N$, $v(A\cup B)\ge v(A)+v(B)-v(A\cap B)$ Thank you.
Cross elasticity of demand is the responsiveness of demand for one product to a change in the price of another product.
1-17. This is sometimes referred to as "money burning" effort. The idea is "because we sell high quality product, we can afford to advertise SO MUCH - once consumers buy our product, they will realize that it is, in fact, high quality and will buy more in the future".
Because it`s like Coca-cola, when MC is super low or almost nothing, but you are paying a lot for the brand, which gives you emotional satisfaction.
Recently I've learned that Inditex (owner of Zara brand) is the biggest fashion group in the world and it's using almost no advertising at all.

In "Uncommon Sense", by Gary Becker and Richard Posner, Posner, going off of Becker's comment, suggests that while a fat tax would be regressive, poverty and obesity are correlated more because of a lack of salience about the causation between soft drinks and obesity.
This depends on how you define the good in question, which is a typical problem when talking about market structure. If the good is "parking at the airport " then it's probably a monopoly since most airports manage their own or through a single contractor on their property.

Consider the following single-agent choice problem under uncertainty. Let $V$ be the state of the world with support $\mathcal{V}$ and probability distribution $P_V\in \Delta(\mathcal{v})$.
You have specialized the definition of BCE in two dimensions: there is only one player, and the player has no private information.
Consider the following static single-agent choice problem under uncertainty. Let $V$ be the state of the world with support $\mathcal{V}$ and probability distribution $P_V\in \Delta(\mathcal{V})$.
A one-player BCE of the game described is a probability distribution $P_{Y,V}\in \Delta(\mathcal{Y}\times \mathcal{V})$ such that: 1) $\forall v \in \mathcal{V}$ $$\sum_{y\in \mathcal{Y}}P_{Y,V}(y,v)=P_V(v)$$ 2) $\forall y\in \mathcal{Y}$ and $\forall \tilde{y}\neq y$ $$ \sum_{v\in \mathcal{V}} [u(y,v)-u(\tilde{y},v)] \times P_{Y,V}(y,v)\geq 0 $$ Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the set of BCE.
The state of the world has support $\mathcal{V}$. The DM receives the payoff $u(y,v)$ depending on the chosen action $y$ the realisation $v$ of $V$.

Primary dealers have a privileged position, so there is value in being registered as a primary dealer. - https://economics.
From the first order condition for optimality, we know that (equation (4) in the paper): $$U_x(x,Z(r)-x,S(r))x'(r) - U_y(x,Z(r)-x,S(r))x'(r) + U_s(x,Z(r)-x,S(r))S'(r)=0.

I had never really heard of this "myth" before. But perhaps that is merely because Bairoch (1993) did such a good job at dismantling this myth.

In my economics class, we saw a proof that if an allocation $ ((\hat x_h), (\hat y_f)), h\in H$ (the set of households), $f\in F$ (the set of firms) is Pareto optimal/efficient, it must necessarily be a solution to the maximization problem: $$ max \quad U_1(x_1) $$ Subject to: $$ U_h(x_h) \ge U_h(\hat x_h), h=2,...
I'm going to state the problem without much context because it is an issue of the math I'm doing, rather than any specific econ concept.
Could somebody explain how Straffin calculated the security levels for Rose and Colin on p. 103? Here are the two pages that describe the problem (I apologize for the bad resolution):
I have a problem with finding a way how to solve this example: We have the company, which has two types of customers indexed as $H$ and $L$.
Suppose that there are two agents, 1 and 2, and two goods, honey (h) and lemon (l), and that the agents' preferences over these goods are defined by the following utility functions: $$u^1(x_h^1, x_l^1)=x_h^1+x_l^1$$ $$u^2(x_h^2, x_l^2)=min[x_h^2, x_l^2]$$ Furthermore, suppose that the agents are assigned the following initial allocations, of the form (h,l): $$w^1=(1/2, 1/2)$$ $$w^2=(3/2, 1/2$$ Given these utility functions and initial allocations, one could draw an edgeworth box and compute the set of pareto efficient outcomes.

Generally the receiver bank / payment-gateway makes the conversion - except for currency accounts where the transaction is made directly into the account or if the sender chooses to make the conversion.

Suppose there are $n$ bidders and a seller. Bidder $i$ observes a private signal $v_i$ from $[a,b]$. Let $\mathcal{X} = \times_{i=1}^n[a,b]$ Each bidder is represented by a random variable, that has a joint distribution $F(\textbf{v})$, where $\textbf{v} = (v_1,v_2,...
To find expected revenue of the seller in a second price auction with reserved price consisting of two bidders who bid their valuations in equilibrium, we do the following : Given that valuations are i.i.
Your reformulation is certainly correct for independent values. However, if value $v_i$ carries information about $v_{-i}$, you cannot write the incentive compatibility like that.

The idea that the long run average cost curve (LRAC) must pass through the minimum points of the short run average cost curves (SRAC) is a fallacy, but it seems to be a remarkably plausible one.
I think your one mistake was writing $\Pr(v_{2}  \beta(v_{1})$ incorrectly. It should be: $$\begin{split} \pi_1(v_1,v_2)=\Pr(v_2\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ =F_{2}(v_2\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ = \beta(v_1)(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ \end{split}$$ $$\begin{split} \left.
Consider a seller offering a single object for sale to two buyers with independent valuations – each bidder’s value is uniformly distributed on [0,1].
Consumer spending initially rises by 5 billion for each 1% increase in household wealth. Investment spending initially increases $20 billion for each 1% decrease in real interest rate.
I think that the first part of your question must ask for a conditional probability. In other words, for $v_1$ and $v_2$ representing valuations of player 1 and player 2, we should have been asked for the derivation (namely, the density) of the following probability: $$Pr( v_1x \land v_2x \;|\; rv_1 \land rv_2) $$ Thus it is equal to: $$\frac{d\left( \frac{(1-F(x))^2}{(1-F(r))^2} \right)}{dx} = \frac{2f(x)(1-F(x))}{(1-F(r))^2}$$ From your words, however, it is deduced that what it asks for is the derivation (so the density) of the following probability: $$Pr(v_1max(r,x) \;\land\; v_2max(x,r))$$ But, assuming wlog x>r, this is just equal to $\frac{d\left( (1-F(x))^2 \right)}{dx} = 2f(x)(1-F(x))$, so there is no place for $r$ since if $v_1$ and $v_2$ are grater than $x$, and $x$ is greater than $r$, then $v_i$>$x$ implies $v_i$>$r$ for $i=1,2$.

Arka likes fries. She wants to consume as much as possible. She consumes either regular (1 oz) or large sizes (5 oz). Draw her indifference curve through $(x_R, x_L) = (10,0)$ and her indifference curve through the bundle $(x_R, x_L) = (10,2)$.
In my finance classes, I always learned that the a firm earning an "economic profit" is one for which its return on invested capital (ROIC) is greater than it's opportunity cost of capital (usually calculated using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital).
I was watching a show on economics, and the guests stated that the way structural deficits measured by the IMF and European Comission usually give antagonic values, and worse, the corrections made to previous estimations may in fact indicate that previous advised policy was in fact wrong and in the opposite sense.
I' m not sure its a law, its what has happened because manufacturing productivity has moved faster. Back when we were eating 1000 kc/d, increasing farm productivity increased out consumption of food, and potentially the size of our income we devoted to food until we hit the 2000 kc/d.

I think it's going to be hard to compare the price for a country with a large internal creditors and another one without, as such a price depends on many parameters apart from that.
I think it depends on the category of literature you're reading. The category of innovation literature has a lot about supply-side cost changes, and about related policies - you'll find lots of work on learning curves, technology diffusion, harnessing economies of scale.
At the level of an individual household it can be rational for poverty and savings to coexist. There are degrees of poverty.
The paper Beyond Cobb-Douglas: Estimation of a CES Production Function with Factor Augmenting Technology should be of use here: Both the recent literature on production function identification and a considerable body of other empirical work on firm expansion assume a Cobb-Douglas production function.
I've come across this little parable purporting to show why exponential discounting is superior to hyperbolic discounting1: The greater bowing [of the hyperbolic discount curve] means that if a hyperbolic discounter engaged in trade with someone who used an exponential curve, she'd soon be relieved of her money.

In the case of Apple at least, the answer is yes: this article dated August 31 2019 talks about the impact of the latest round of tariffs on Apple products produced in China.
Through a quick research I have found that VEC, VAR, SVAR models are the most common. Are they though good forecasters?
If it's just knowing about the models, I'd suggest starting with Hamilton's "Time Series Analysis" but any book like it will do.
We also commonly use measures like means squared error, mean absolute percentage error, Theil's U, etc. etc. You then compare your forecast predictions to known data and to those of other forecasts.

I want to know the impact of misspecifying lag levels in AR models. What will be the impact of estimating AR(P-1) on the estimated coefficients of $\phi_1 - \phi_{p-1}$, can they be consistently estimated.
I'm aware of Blanchard, Olivier, and Jordi Gali. 2007. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Oil Shocks: Why Are the 2000s So Different from 1970s.
It seems to be a young field, but is there any consensus on strength and weaknesses of this new shock? Is it the answer to some puzzles such as the risk premium puzzle?
Are DSGE models used for the day-to-day government policy estimation and optimization? E.g. Can similar estimations be made for investments in healhtcare, for industrial policy, for investments in RD, for estimation for welfare programmes?

I have a question about a derivation in Abraham (1987)'s simple job market matching model (equations 3 through 7): She begins by writing down tautologies: J - V = L - U = E where J is the number of jobs, V is the number of vacancies, L is the total labor force, U is the total unemployed, and E is the total employed.
Note that function $p$ actually depends upon a single variable $u/v$ and I prefer avoiding the abuse of notation (source of confusion) and write $p(u/v) = P(u,v)$.
$ \textbf{Answer:} $ Simply put, it does not matter which good goes on which axis as long as the relationship between the two goods is adjusted for correctly.
Let $X = h(Y)$. A first-order Taylor expansion around $E(Y) = \mu_y$ gives $$X \approx h[\mu_y] + h'[\mu_y]\cdot [Y-\mu_y]$$ This easily leads to $$\sigma^2_x \approx \big(h'[\mu_y]\big)^2\cdot \sigma^2_y$$ Since $$\eta_{x,y} \equiv h'\cdot \frac Yh \implies \eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) = h'(\mu_y)\frac {\mu_y}{h(\mu_y)} \implies h'(\mu_y) = \eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) \cdot \frac {h(\mu_y)}{\mu_y}$$ Substituting, $$\sigma^2_x \approx \left(\eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) \cdot \frac {h(\mu_y)}{\mu_y}\right)^2\cdot \sigma^2_y$$ Taking the square root we are led to $$\frac {\sigma_x}{h(\mu_y)} \approx \eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) \cdot \frac {\sigma_y}{\mu_y} $$ The difference of the above from the expression in the question is that a) The elasticity must be evaluated at the center of the Taylor expansion used and b) $h(\mu_y)$ is usually equal to $E(X)=E[h(Y)]=\mu_x$ only to a first approximation, due to Jensen's inequality.
If X and Y are normal, then the distribution of X conditional on Y is: $$ X | (Y = y) = N(\mu_x + \rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}(y - \mu_y), (1-\rho)^2 \sigma^2_x )$$ Therefore, $E[X|Y = y] = \mu_x + \rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}(y - \mu_y) = (\mu_x - \mu_y (\rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y})) + (\rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y})y $ which is linear in $y$.

I do not have any economics background, but currently I have some data sets regarding price index. Sorry if the question is confusing.
Is it that the consumer would not consume anything of the nonlinear good in case of insufficient wealth? No, it is exactly the other way around.
The utility function of the consumer is $5x^{0. 5}y^-{0. 5x^{0. 5}}{1000} = \frac{2. 5}y^{0. 5x^{-0. 5}$ Substituting them into (1) gives: $\frac{2.

If OA is a part of FA. The second equation follows from the first: $CA + KA = FA \wedge OA \neq 0 \Rightarrow FA - OA = CA +KA -OA \neq CA +KA$.

Let me rephrase the question in my own words: in an environment where automation increasingly is taking over, are there alternatives besides leaving the have-nots behind or providing a basic income?
I can safely assume that the market is efficient in the sense that two-week-old prices don't help to predict the price of the current week.
The negation would be "there does not exist at least one person that is better off, or, there exists someone that is worse off.
I am trying to decipher certain abbreviations related to balance of payments. They are strange, and i have to admit i have no idea what did they mean furthermore i was not able to find anything relevant via google and also i am not able to find them in my macroeconomics textbook.
The Balance of Payments (BOP) records, in summary form, every single international transaction. * Also, the BOP uses a double-entry accounting system, where every entry MUST be balanced (hence the name) by an entry (or entries) that is (or are together) equal and opposite.

I agree with Dan it is likely a typo. Some definitions (using your notations) Investment : $f_0$ Investment one year later : $f_1$ Net income : $f_1 - f_0$ ROI: $-1 + \frac{f_1}{f_0}$ It follows that the correct code should be ROI = (goog/goog.

A game where the payoff function $F_1,F_2$ are such that for any two strategy profiles $s,s'$ $$ F_1(s)  F_1(s') \Leftrightarrow F_2(s)  F_2(s') $$ is called an antagonistic game.

I've been reading up on the von-Neumann and Savage proofs for the existence of an expected utility representation. Clearly this violates Allais' paradox.
Two players simultaneously announce a prime number less than 20. Denoting $p_{i}$ the number announced by the player $i$, the payoffs are: -If $p_{1}+p_{2}14$ each player receives as payment the value of $p_{i}+1$.
Using the data in the wikipedia link provided by @denesp we have the following picture, based on (2014 I think) Public Spending as percentage of GDP.

For what values $x$, $y$ the profile $(D,L)$ is Pareto optimal? \begin{array}{c|ccc}  L  R \\ \hline U  x,5  x+2,y \\ D 1,-1  x,0 \\ \end{array} Is correct $x1$ ?
Consider the following problem \begin{align} \max_u F(x,u)\\ \text{s.t. } u \in [0,\bar u]. \end{align} Any idea how to merge the two constraints $u \geq 0$ and $\bar u - u \geq 0$ into one constraint $f(u,\bar u) \geq 0$?
Consider the game below. $$ \begin{array}{|r|c|c|} \hline LR\\\hline U5,14,0\\\hline M6,03,1\\\hline D6,44,4\\\hline \end{array} $$ Both $U$ and $M$ are weakly dominated by $D$.
Hint: You can convert the game into the following normal form: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline  Steal  Split \\\hline Steal  100\beta, 0 100(1-\alpha),0 \\\hline Split  50(\alpha+\beta),50+50(1-\alpha-\beta)  50,50 \\\hline \end{array} \end{equation} Note that Steal is a weakly dominant strategy for player 2, so (Split, Split) can never be an equilibrium.
Pick any set of non-negative $p_1,\dots,p_n$ such that $p_1+\cdots+p_n=1$. The convex combination of degenerate lotteries $L^1,\dots,L^n$ with the $p_i$'s can be written as \begin{align} p_1L^1+\cdots+p_nL^n=p_1(1,0,\dots,0)+\cdots+p_n(0,\dots,0,1)\\ =\bigl(p_1(1)+p_2(0)+\cdots+p_n(0),\;\dots,\;p_1(0)+\cdots+p_{n-1}(0)+p_n(1)\bigr)\\ =(p_1,\dots,p_n).

] The figures revealed that Denmark’s richest 10 percent now own as much as 70 percent of the rest of the population put together – a clear indication the government didn’t need to consider any more reforms aimed at benefiting the wealthiest Danes.
808 was the third-highest in the world. As of the year 2000, Denmark's income Gini coefficient of 0. (After-transfer) income inequality and wealth inequality are obviously not the same thing, but I would intuitively expect that, all else equal, they would be reasonably well correlated across countries.
Compare the Gini coefficients of {2,2,2,2,2,6,10,10,10,10,10} and of {1,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,26}: the former will have a Gini index of about 0.
I believe the following is the multiplicative property of bilinearity: $$ Y=F(K,AL) $$ $$ c_1 F(K,AL) = F(c_1 K, AL) $$ $$ c_2 F(K,AL) = F(K, c_2 AL) $$ But when we have multiplied through the production function with a constant we have done so through each term as below $$ c_3 F(K,AL) = F(c_3 K, c_3 AL) $$ e.g.

3 trillion ($3. 63\times10^{13}$). How much this makes you better off depends on your initial state. Concepts of low- and middle-class are somewhat ambigious.
A rich person can own companies, shares, houses used for renting etc. that are worth billions of $US. And then he/she can have only his own wage as a leisure wealth.
The Gini coefficient is defined as the normalized Gini index. If $G$ is the Gini index, $0 \leq G \leq \frac{n-1}{n}$. The Gini coefficient $G^* = \frac{n}{n-1} G$ is a normalization such that $0\leq G^* \leq 1$.
I was reading an article from 2015 stating that 1% of the world has half of the world wealth. Which is it? They have several figures such as the world's billionaries have around 7 trillions dollars or the global world wealth pyramid which shows a percent of population by percent of the total wealth etc.
Both distributions are often modelled log-normal, with a substantial number of zeros. A pareto distribution is also sometimes used (Piketty  Saez (2012), p.

$AVCAR$ means, without considering fixed cost, the firm is making a profit of $AR-AVC0$ per unit of output. Compare the two options: keep producing vs shutdown: Keep producing: $\text{Avg Profit}=\underbrace{AR-AVC}_{0}-AFC$ Shutdown: $\text{Avg Profit}=0-AFC$ Since $AVCAR$, staying in production is better since the revenues can be used to offset part of the fixed costs already incurred.
I'm trying to find some figures, however I cannot come up with a correct formulation, or lack of information in this field.
Well, I got basically a question about economics of our world, I hope I'm wrong in my assumptions, because it's pretty ugly and I'm really hope it's more about me being wrong than it's actually the truth.

I believe the money pump works like this: At $T=0$ borrow a hundred dollars from Henry the hyperbolic discounter for the full time period $t$.
ASSET PRICING THEORY: Cochrane, Asset Pricing is a good book in that it displays the way that hard-core asset pricers see the world.
I've come across this little parable purporting to show why exponential discounting is superior to hyperbolic discounting1: The greater bowing [of the hyperbolic discount curve] means that if a hyperbolic discounter engaged in trade with someone who used an exponential curve, she'd soon be relieved of her money.
I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice / lectures / introduction to stochastic optimization that could be applied to monetary policy.

Thanks for any help! Weak Pareto$’$: $\forall x, y \in X$, $\forall i \in N$: $( \ u_i(x) \  \ u_i(y) \ ) \ \Longrightarrow \ (xPy)$.
I don't think the edgeworth box will help here since there is only 1 good in the economy that is exchangeable. According to 1's utility function, he would always want to allocate his entire endowment of time to leisure.
In social choice theory, Arrow's impossibility theorem, the general possibility theorem or Arrow's paradox is an impossibility theorem stating that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) So, I'm looking for an example where the preferences satisfy unrestricted domain, non dictatorship, IIA and is an ordering, but not meet the Pareto criteria.
What does "SEN" / "sen" (possibly an abbreviation? ) mean in a shareholders' context? In particular, I am wondering how to interpret "sen" in the following context: "Earnings Per Share (sen)" This can be encountered a lot, as a simple google query "Earnings Per Share (sen)" shows.
There are at least two other examples of SWFs that satisfy these conditions. You could also look at Chapter 2 of the book Axioms of Cooperative Decision-Making, by Hervé Moulin (1988).

Let the set of alternatives be $A = \left\{a_1,a_2,... ,a_k\right\}$. Let the number of players be $n$. Let the set of preference orderings over $A$ be $\mathcal{P}$.
My favorite example is the initial formulation of Arrow's impossibility theorem in the first edition of Arrows' "Social Choice and Individual Values" (1951).

This question comes out of Hansen's Econometrics ((https://www. ssc. wisc. edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics. pdf)) In section 2.

If the function $ f(x,y) = (x-\alpha)^\beta \cdot y^{1-\beta} $ is homogeneous of degree $ k $, then it must be true that $ f(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^k \cdot f(x,y) $ for $ \lambda \in \mathbb{R} $ and some constant $ k $.
The asymptotic sampling distribution, after taking plim, of the OLS estimator is given by $\sqrt{N}(\hat{\beta}-\beta) = E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} \left(1/\sqrt{N} \sum_{I=1}^NX_ie_i \right) $ It must be shown that the asymptotic variance can be written as: $ Var[E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} 1/\sqrt{N} \sum_{I=1}^NX_ie_i] = \left( E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} \right) \left( E[X_iX_i^T e_i^2]\right) \left( E[X_i X_i^T]^{-1} \right) $ Because the variance is linear in parameters, my idea was to start like this: $V[\sqrt{N}(\hat{\beta}-\beta)] = \sqrt{N}Var[\hat{\beta}] + 0$ Because the $Var[\beta]=0$.
Edit: My previous answer contained a mistake for the case where $x$ is restricted to $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$. Moreover, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds strictly unless $y - \delta$ is a multiple of $p$.
I'm having trouble with a question from Ariel Rubinstein's book, Lecture Notes in Microeconomic Theory. It's the problem 2 from Problem Set 7.
First, $$\sqrt{N}(\hat\beta - \beta) = \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i X_i^T \right)^{-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i e_i.

You have $$ \begin{align} u(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b, \lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a) = \sqrt{\lambda a + (1 - \lambda)b} + \sqrt{\lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a} \\ \geq \lambda\sqrt{a} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{b} + \lambda\sqrt{b} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{a} \\ = \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \\ = u(a, b) \end{align}$$ The inequality in the second line follows from Jensen's inequality for concave functions.
I'm going to answer my own question. Consider multiplying all prices and income (i.e. , the wage) by a common factor $\lambda0$.

Start here $$0. 75/p_xx= 0. 25/p_yy$$ Multiply both sides by $p_xx p_yy$, you get: $$0. 75p_yy=0. 25p_xx$$ Add $0. 75p_xx$ to both sides, you get: $$0.

Regarding the nature of the pins, the fact that one step is "to whiten" may suggest that they were indeed pins and not nails.

In his famous description of the division of labour: One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper ...
So (considering discrete changes) if your income increases by $1$ kudo, maximized utility will increase by $1/p_y$. It makes sense then to treat $y$ as the numeraire good, in which case its price is undetermined, our budget constraint is $p_xx+ y = M$, and the effect on the utility function by an increase in $M$ by one unit is $1$...

No, there is no such evidence, because Russia does export gold, though it also adds to its reserves For example Sputnik News (established by the Russian government-controlled news agency Rossiya Segodnya) reported Exports of fine gold from Russia increased 2,5 times to 56,6 tons (1,82 million oz) last year, compared to 22,4 tons in 2016, according to the Russian State Assaying Chamber under the Ministry of Finance. ...

Basically the Lucas solution to SMD was the representative agent (which brought its own problems). 248).

Let's begin by mapping out some context by assuming the following goals of implementing QE: prevent dire systemic liquidity concerns reach inflation targets manage expectations in the private sector If I'm not mistaken, the vast majority of QE has been government debt securities.
Question: Are there any econometric theories that are applicable in studying what is commonly referred to as Pay-To-Play, in the world of youth sports.
Because commercial banks have used injected liquidities to consolidate their balance sheet instead of stimulating demands by creating credits (that did not previously exist when they make loans).
Yes it can. If debt originates from the banking system, then it potentially has a side effect of money creation. Whether or not money is actually created when a bank loan is made depends on the banking system's regulatory framework, and the lending policies of its banks, and these can vary widely.

Define the CES function $q : \mathbb R_+^n \to [0,1]$ by \begin{align} q(x) = \left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n{x_j^\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\right]^\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1} \end{align} where $x \in \mathbb R_+^n$ denote differentiated inputs, $\sigma \in \mathbb R_{++} \setminus \{1\} $ the constant elasticty of substitution among inputs and $q(x)$ a homogeneous output.
Let's look at the cournot model of competition. There are $n$ firms, each with idiosyncratic marginal cost $c_i$. Each firm simultaneously chooses its output (supply) quantity, $q_i$.
The first term on the RHS of the Slutsky equation (as you write it) should be $\frac{\partial h_i(p_i,p_j,I)}{\partial p_j}$, not $\frac{\partial h_i(p_i,p_j,I)}{\partial p_i}$.
Didn't manage to get to a definitve answer in one shot, but it seems to me that Jensen inequality is not going to help much.

In Slutski equation, we have: $$\frac{\partial x_i(p,w)}{\partial p_j} = \frac{\partial h_i (p,u)}{\partial p_j} -\frac{\partial x_i(p,w)}{\partial w}x_j(p,w)$$ If $i \neq j$, the substitution effect $\frac{\partial h_i (p,u)}{\partial p_j}  0$ if there are only two goods.
Recall that the slutsky equation is: $$\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial p_i}=\frac{\partial h_i}{\partial p_i}-\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial m}x_i$$ I know $\frac{\partial h_i}{\partial p_i}$ defined as the substitution effect, the second part of the equation is the income effect.
Consider a static model with CES demand. Can I set $C P^{\eta} = 1$ as my numeraire so that $c_j^{*} = p_j^{-\eta}$? More generally, what is required of a numeraire?

In the past I read something like this: If basic expenses for family went from 100€ to 200€ but its wage went from 200€ to 400€ it can expend more than before.
So, in short, no, economic models aren't blank-slate, although using education as the only measure of human capital, which is sometimes done for pragmatic reasons, does look a tiny bit like a blank-slate assumption.
The German mathematician-turned-economist William Lexis (1837-1914) considered capitalism as "dat[ing] back to the Middle Ages": Large-scale enterprise based on the ownership of money, and operating on the basis of such monetary power; and its beginnings which date back to the Middle Ages are to be found in commercial and banking enterprises.
The problem is that there are no indifference "curves" but indifference "areas". Consider the following graph: For a reference bundle $A$ (equivalent to $\{2,3\}$), the gray regions indicate the areas of indifference, based on your definition of preferences (the black lines are part of the indifference areas).
The MRS is a function of $x$ and $y$. The fact that $y$ doesn't appear in the formula simply means that this function is constant in $y$.

Quality of life matters too. This sometimes appears in the labor economics literature as "compensating differential". So it's probably not enough to weight cost of living by median or average wage unless you can objectively determine that all other factors are identical (e.
$M\cdot V=P\cdot Y \Leftrightarrow M=\frac{P}{V}\cdot Y\\ \frac{1}{V}=k \Leftrightarrow M=kPY$ So suppose we keep $V$ and $Y$ fixed and vary $M$, $P$ varies as well and this means $kPY$ also varies (because of P).

In the article where I found equation 1 (Chan and Chang, 2014), they have delineted the parameters as so: $R_{t+}= \max [0, R_t]$, $R_{t–} = \min [0, R_t]$, and $R_t$ is the monthly return of stock, bond, or real estate.
I don’t really see the connection you are drawing. As @Fizz has pointed out, immigration usually happens over time and maybe when immigrants grow old there will be more immigrants to support all of the new old.
For a project in experimental economics, I thought of doing something related to expected utility theory/prospect theory, but using grades instead of money.
This is called the Alchian–Allen effect. Another example is that Australians drink higher-quality Californian wine than Californians, and vice versa, because it is only worth the transportation costs for the most expensive wine.
I think this is almost certainly wrong. I recommend "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism" as a good book to read on this subject.

The outrageous tow and impound fees were not. Every insurance contract I have ever seen would be voided by lack of license.
The statement ABCGym refuses to refund payment it accepted for membership to a gym ABCGym closed. If they still ask the wearer to leave, the wearer would be wise to comply and perhaps take legal action to enforce his or her membership rights, which will depend on the contract details as mentioned above.

I know a trade secret must be kept secret. It can be shared with a third party if the third party signs a legally binding NDA (non-disclosure agreement) before being told about the trade secret.
Thank you! Additionally, can company specific probationary periods have any effect on this? I had a qiuck question related to how salary and benefits work for salaried exempt employees, specifically in the state of Florida (If that changes anything) If an employee is salaried exempt, are they entitled to holiday pay?
Is information required for an Unemployment application exempt from NDAs? but does that mean I can't explain the circumstances of my firing to the Unemployment office?
Could I face any legal liability for doing so? As an employer I have a restrictive covenant clause in my employment contracts to prevent my employees seeking employment with my direct competition for a period of 6 months.

Generally, in fact, there is a presumption against restraints as it interferes with the common law right to contract, etc.
What if this is a full-time employee, opposed to a contractor? Let's say my company hires a contractor. If there is not enough revenue to where their share would be greater than or equal to minimum wage, is the company required to cover the difference?
Here are the terms that govern that agreement: Kickstarter has separate agreements with creators and backers but the creators and backers have their own contract.
I would really appreciate citation from authoritative sources. In Canada can an employer require its employees not to discuss wages (either internal or external of the company)?
I know that the employer of an independent contractor cannot be held liable for negligence of the contractor under vicarious liability, but are there any other such situations where the employer would not be liable for the negligent acts of the employee done within the course of employment?

In the U.S. some states do not require cars to display license plates on the front of a vehicle, but a majority require plates on both the front and rear, as shown in the map below.
From the New Hampshire Department of Motor Vehicles. The New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) requires you to have a retail dealer license if you’re in the business of selling 5 motor vehicles or more to the public during a period of 12 months.
Divsion 17, article 1, chapter 1, section 40000. 1: Except as otherwise provided in this article, it is unlawful and constitutes an infraction for any person to violate, or fail to comply with any provision of this code, or any local ordinance adopted pursuant to this code.
(1-plate exception for motorcycles etc)... If it was issued, you must display it. but you can still get busted for driving your car.

Yeah, of course, it would be the same as not displaying the plate. It's just a ticket, but technically you would be breaking the law.
Are these plates simply special ones issued by the commissioner? If not, how is this practice in accordance with state law?
RCW 46. 37. and it is illegal to sell them. Then we can ask if "which is in use upon the highways" is true. This is not obvious, because that clause could be interpreted as meaning "which is at some time or other in use upon the highway", or else as "at those times when it is in use upon the highway".

I agree that this is location specific. A "red arrow" is the same as any other red light under Wisconsin statutes. Vehicular traffic facing a red signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of an intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection or at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible sign or pavement marking and shall remain standing until green or other signal permitting movement is shown.
(2) Self-defence means any defensive action that is necessary to avert an imminent unlawful attack on oneself or another.
Taking the stated facts at face value (i.e. (d) If no one able to receive information. (c) Exhibiting license. (b) Duty to give certain information.
A more clear example is when you encounter someone committing a felonious assault. You can brandish your gun and order them to stop.

In context of Indian legislature, I know that when a bill is put to vote in the Union parliament and gets the votes of majority of the members in all the houses, it is sent to the President of India for his assent and on receiving the President of India's assent, it becomes an Act.
They have the equity of their home, though. Is there a way that I can purchase the home over time, with it still remaining in their possession?

Using your school's logo is probably copyright infringement, assuming the logo's copyright has not expired (i.e. , its author has been dead for for over 70 years or it was a work-for-hire work published over 95 years ago) and assuming the logo contains sufficient creative expression to qualify for copyright at all.
Apparently there are some "laws" that make it illegal to sail dirty ships in international waters. I read an article giving only the information that "Maritime laws prohibit stained tankers from navigating international waters.

Also, in the terms  agreement for the auction, it is disclosed to the buyers that the auctioneer can place bids on behalf of the seller.

That's an interesting question. Because of the way OTPs work, you can supply an carefully selected arbitrary key to get any output you desire.

The other driver was ruled at fault in the accident) As a handy way to illustrate my experience, here is a scenario: So you're at work and I go to your parking lot and smash your car up and total it so that the repair cost exceeds the value.

This is not gambling. In fact calling it MLM is a huge stretch - MLM implies multi level and this would not qualify. Assuming for the moment that this did qualify as MLM, its legality would be dependent on jurisdiction - which you have not specified.
Pyramid MLM in illegal in India. Where source of income is from recruiting downline and the joining fees. I had seen a lot of such companies workings.

Moreover, it would likely also be trademark infringement (a right which will not be expired, as long as it is still in active use), since that school's logo is probably used in a trademark capacity to indicate the source of a good or service.

It is hard to measure accuracy in absolute terms because figuring out the truth is the problem that trials seek to solve in the first place.
, do you still live in this county, are you a U.S. Why Might A Prosecutor Fail To Object? So, if the prosecutor was really appalled by the dismissal for cause of so many women and felt that this would impair the prosecution's chance of obtaining a conviction materially, the prosecutor would have to dismiss the criminal charges so as to vacate the trial, before evidence was presented to the jury, and then refile the charges (assuming that this would be possible consistent with statutes of limitation and speedy trial requirements).
Conversely, the guilty plea and plea bargaining were until recently unknown to French law, and now it only applies to crimes for which the prosecution seeks a sentence not exceeding one year imprisonment.
How can this be possible? It also doesn't help that the rules governing judicial review of statutes and other governmental actions for their legality and constitutionality are rarely bright-line rules.

Improper argument to a jury on this basis, however, is frequently acknowledged to be error, but held to be harmless by the Texas courts.

I'm curious as to how the US legal system determines who should present evidence and how much evidence is required by them to prove one side of an argument against a counterargument.

How long this copyright last or sustain? In India, the duration of copyright is life of the author + 60 years. Can books used as in public domain after expiration of copyright?

Who Is On The Risk? If the insured had losses beyond what was covered by the insurance payment, or losses different in kind from what was covered by the insurance payment, and the insured recovered damages from the party at fault for those losses, this additional recovery would not be subject to the subrogation lien.
Talk to the Board. I'm so smart! They are to inform you of your rights and guide you on the appropriate action, forms and procedure to assist you in resolving any issues you have.
A tenant can only be held liable for any damage that is caused during the course of the tenancy if not pre-existing (marked by notation in your lease, or photos upon move-in).
I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of July. You'll notice that I made it $875 this month. This is because we have not yet moved the cats into the apartment and don't think they'll be coming within the next month or so.
Why? In some states, this can be months. In your case, you vacated the property. Why? Landlords take on HUGE responsibilities for which there seems to be little respect for.

This is the process we refer to as demosaicing. They only store a single brightness value per pixel. Think of how it is when we are seeing under very limited spectrum red lighting.

What you see on your screen is a bit different than what I see on my screen. Hence the reason we see the lighter 192,192,192 gray rather than the darker 128,128,128 gray.
While there may not be a "right" answer to this question, there are "correct" answers. When shooting a scene, particularly those that have a broad range of contrast that may be on the border of, or possibly slightly beyond, the 5-6 stop dynamic range of a digital camera, capturing enough tonal range in the shadows can be difficult.
5 trillion (16-bit) colors that are very accurately described by the LUT. 4 trillion (14-bit) or 281. 5 trillion). This increase in potential distinct colors means that gradients become considerably smoother and more finely delineated when using a higher bit depth.

I am looking for hardware for calibration of canvas prints. There are many solutions for monitors (as Datacolor Spyder, X-Rite i1 Display Pro, X-Rite ColorMunki) and paper printers (as Datacolor SpyderPRINT), but what hardware is needed to take color profiles for canvas printers?
I had also the same problem and tried following sensors: Spyder 4: spectraview profiler detectet also for calibration the Spyder 4 and did the job with an inconsistent result and with a high difference of Delta values.
Choices for backlight are: Unknown, Fluorescent (CCFL), White LED, and RGD LED. Which of these should I select to match my built in screen?
My in-warranty Dell U2412M monitor is wide gamut, and I've set it for Adobe RGB. Yet when I calibrate the monitor with a Spyder 4 by DataColor, I can only get 79% of the RGB color gamut.
If you're serious about photographic editing, you should at least be using a colorimeter to get an accurate colour profile for your display; better still, you'd be using a wide-gamut display, something like the NEC MultiSync PA271W which has a good reputation.

However, the standard brightness of the iMac screen is very bright, do I need to turn the brightness down before calibrating?
I purchased an ASUS PA329Q monitor to replace an NEC LCD2490WUXi2. I set up both monitors side-by-side and calibrated them to the same parameters (sRGB, D65, 150nit, gamma 2.

The notch in the bayonet tab in your 4th and 5th pictures are a dead giveaway for being a Minolta SR/MC/MD mount. The lack of a shutter-preferred autoexposure lug means it is not an MD lens.

This appears to be the Minolta MC/MD mount. The giveaway is the aperture actuation lug inside the bayonet mount, and the notch in one of the bayonet tabs opposite the aperture lug, at the upper-left position of the bayonet ring in your 2nd photo.
Whether a metal can rust depends on the metal. Not really. Brass? This zinc layer is usually a little bit more hard-wearing than paint would be but usually makes it non-smooth.
Hang them. Use some wood sticks tied with some cotton treads hardened with glue. Use a metal hanger unwrapped. Use a PVC rig and hang the watches using "invisible" nylon thread hooked with unwrapped paper clips.
Even if the "MC" stand for "multi-Coated" and was printed on the lens for all of the various mounts for which it was made, the "MC" led me to compare it to the Minolta mount.
I had in mind being able to use either of them, but not both at the same time. More or less like BlackRapid's hook that you can attach or detach from the bottom of the camera.

So after a little digging and with the help of Murat's hint I found the following field in some pictures. This basically is the way that Adobe Lightroom stores the information and it could be used as a defacto standard in your project.
exiftool can be used to create a gpx file, as Unapiedra describes. In some Linux distributions, the gpx. fmt does not need to be created because it is already installed.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. It is possible to handhold stacks at these magnifications, but not easy.
Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?
I'm probably waaaaay too late in answering to help you out with your decision (which I'm sure you've made already) but maybe my answer will help others who have a similar question.
Sorry if the question sounds flippant, it isn't meant to be, and I know that this is asking an opinion rather than a verifiable fact but bear with me...

How many other similar services can you name? they're really few. So, no, I don't think that flickr is dying, considering that they're relatively unique in this business.
What SHOULD it do A 35 mm f/1. Your experience will vary with circumstance, luck, impact surface and angle that the camera hits.
That is, set your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your ISO (so 1/200th if at ISO 200) and aperture to f/16. Update: Found that there is a Looney 11 rule For astronomical photos of the moon's surface, set aperture to f/11 and shutter speed to the [reciprocal of the] ISO film speed [or ISO setting]."
I have a Canon PowerShot A3100IS digital camera. I was taking pictures but turned it off with the lens still open. I turned it back on, it loaded then made a beeping sound then a black screen came on with white letters stating: Lens error, will shut down automatically, restart camera and it turned off.
Wow, there are so many things that can be affected... Here and here are nice writeups with interactive graphics illustrating the two most common types of SLR autofocus systems.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.

Flickr is dying in the Yogi Berra sense: "Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded. " That is, it's lost some of its social media impact because it has become so dilute.

Sawgrass Gel Sublimation Inks (SubliJet-R) have been created in cartridges that fit the specific Ricoh printers. The ink lines would not work if the OEM inks were fed into the printer, so what your ad means is that no ink is in the lines and the printers are therefore "Sublimation Ready".
I've been looking around at various printers to use on-site for photo printing and one of the printers I came across was the Ricoh 3110DN and while I'm normally pretty good with this stuff, something confused me about the specs as on a couple of sites it is listed as being "sublimation ready" but then goes on to discuss the gel ink system it has.
Maybe, Ricoh Theta S matches your requirement. It has all the features you asked for which includes - HD recording (up to 25 mins), 30fps, Wi-Fi capability.
You can purchase a filter holder from Lee. http://www. leefilters. com/index. php/camera-directory/camera-dir-list/category/mounts-for-polyester-filters You can make a frame of cardboard to hold the polyester square in your holder.
In the posts above the mention of "Sublimation Ready" in the context of Ricoh printers using Sawgrass Gel Sublimation Inks (SubliJet-R) is about heat transfer imprinting and not to be confused with "dye sublimation" printers like some older Olympus or Sony "photo" printers where the printers were used typically during "event photography" ...

There are lens filter wrenches available, such as these, but I find a rubber band works just as well, and always carry a few in my gadget bag.
The GH4 still trumps the GX8 for serious video work - you've noted the lack of headphone socket on the GX8 which is definitely important, but the DPReview preview notes a couple of potentially even bigger differences: Unlike the video-focused GH4, the GX8 doesn't offer 10-bit HDMI output and can't output video over HDMI at all while recording.
I wonder what is the purpose of the metal grid structure outside of the lens, for example, in the Fuji GX617. When you put a set of human hands in the same frame with a GX617, it becomes more apparent just how large the GX617 is.

I will try my best to answer this. LV is just an industry standard to simplify the Lux value. For a camera to be exposing correctly, it is said that it must have the following consistencies: LV = 12 (or 10,240 Lux) ISO = 100 Aperture = f5.

For a project I want to use a USB-camera (https://www. Thanks for any advice. EDIT update after answer below Thanks to Michael's help and information found on https://en.
If choosing a xenon flash, GN is a common reference. Come to led panel, there is lm/m and lux. This is a spec. of led panel: LM: 520/m LUX: 1m: 650, 2m:170, 3m:80 Whats EV equivalent of above figure?
Through @MichaelClark's help to clarify my question and @Achifaifa's hint to look at film curves, I found the answer to my question.
Sunlight is exposure value = 15. It's about 100 000 lux. So, with e.g. 1000 is approximately 10 doublings (well, ok, to be exact, 10 doublings is 1024).
EV = log2(f^2/T) LV = EV + log2(ISO/100) Question is to those that this is already clear. ) What is a realistic example of when we would actually use the LV = formula ?

If you know the daytime brightness for a properly exposed scene, and the nighttime brightness, you can just calculate how many stops difference between the two you have and set the night aperture accordingly.
The easy part is the absolute answer as usually defined. 5 Lux or about 1 EV brighter than I said above. They say: EV Lux Foot-Candle - 1 1.

I'm curious about a photographic technique called 'Miksang photography. ' What is Miksang photography? What are some resources for helping me to learn how to 'do' Miksang photography (or incorporate it into my photography)?
The term "levels" in Miksang refers to different levels of perception not proficiency. (See: "phenomenology"; Phenomenology of Perception by Merleau-Ponty; Cartier-Bresson; Phenomenology and Photography blog by Knut Skjærven.

The word "Miksang" is Tibetan for "Good Eye". For me, the approach is subjective. It's effectively "Zen and the art of photography".
I have a Canon PowerShot A3100IS digital camera. I was taking pictures but turned it off with the lens still open. I turned it back on, it loaded then made a beeping sound then a black screen came on with white letters stating: Lens error, will shut down automatically, restart camera and it turned off.

Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?

Since the unit conversion says that W = J / s, so Ws = (J / s) * s = J, thus the unit J could just as well have been used.
A beauty dish gives a softer light than an unmodified flash, but not as soft as a softbox or shoot-through umbrella. This means that you can control the light more than when using a softbox.
Since the walls and ceiling are not cooperating, you'll have to actually move the SB700 off the camera. You can get a TTL cable for about $20.

Voila! Softened flash, no more Coccoon shots. You can use the translucent ones as diffusers for pop-up flashes. Take the lid off, cut a notch out of one side, place it on the flash and put the lid back on.
2 seconds. :) Innovatronix (Tronix) has a new external power source called the SPEEDFIRE II that has both the high voltage output and dummy batteries.
How reasonable is this assumption? Do flashes wear out? I'm under impression that a flash (both a built-in unit and an external speedlight) uses some kind of very high power lamp which may have limited durability.
When you trigger the shutter, the switch would close, 300V would flow and it would flash. If it was off, then there is no need to worry.
For high speed work I would look into the Paul C Buff Einstein. There's a pretty thorough write-up here: http://www. robgalbraith.

I enjoy visiting a good aviary to capture birds, but often they are caged. My strategy is then to move as close as possible to the fence, resulting in a blurred fence foreground and the subject in focus: Still, often the blur lines are clearly visible, which I then try to reduce or remove in post processing.
There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.
I'm probably waaaaay too late in answering to help you out with your decision (which I'm sure you've made already) but maybe my answer will help others who have a similar question.
Sorry if the question sounds flippant, it isn't meant to be, and I know that this is asking an opinion rather than a verifiable fact but bear with me...

How many other similar services can you name? they're really few. So, no, I don't think that flickr is dying, considering that they're relatively unique in this business.
What SHOULD it do A 35 mm f/1. Your experience will vary with circumstance, luck, impact surface and angle that the camera hits.
The moon is bathed in full sunshine, so the Sunny 16 rule should give you a good starting point. That is, set your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your ISO (so 1/200th if at ISO 200) and aperture to f/16.
Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?
Wow, there are so many things that can be affected... Assuming there is damage (an 18" drop onto carpet isn't likely to have damaged anything, but it's possible) the most likely situation might be a warping of the lens mount so that the mount isn't parallel with the sensor (either the focus sensor or the main imaging sensor).

Kirlian photograph is a high contact print photography. You can find equipment and additional information here: http://www.
What is the easiest way of taking Kirlian pictures (photographic techniques used to capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges)?
If you google 4X18 frame, several results come up. Most are for the same brand name, Craig, and are fulfilled by Sears/K-mart.
How can I do that? Is the difference mainly a result of different equipment, ability to frame a shot, camera settings, lens, natural lighting, post-production or something else?

I was experimenting with the bulb mode of my Canon EOS 600D camera. I realised, in the image there were these red, blue and white pixels that are also seen in the screenshot.
or I can see what I can build in automator to have it do the actions you require, as it shouldn't be too hard. You could always take a screenshot of each step, if using a Mac you can bring up the screenshot application, and create a box the exact size of the photo in the develop module, with all of the bounding boxes hidden to make it as large as possible, while pressing cmd›z or undo, to go back through the steps, making sure to click the screenshot button each time, macOS actually takes a pretty high quality screenshot, you could then bring it into any gif making program you desire, even photoshop, and create your gif with custom times between each frame to speed it up or slow it down.
I agree with Imre and Craig. In this case, undoubtedly more is better, so I am quite sure it won't let you down. I am not familiar with either units, though.
Is a lens like the one below actually available? The photographer in the movie uses this lens to covertly photograph the scene happening to his right using this lens.

The polar radiation pattern of Fig. 5 204 1 80 1. We get: dΩ = dS cos(θ) / (z² + r²) dΦ = I(θ) dΩ = I(0) dS cos²(θ) / (z² + r²) E(r) = dΦ / dS = I(0) cos²(θ) / (z² + r²) but since cos(θ) = z / √(z² + r²), and I(0) = E(0) z², E(r) = E(0) cos⁴(θ) = E(0) z⁴ / (z² + r²)² which leads to the following iluminance pattern, as a function of the distance r to the center of the spot: r (m) E (lx) 0 318 0.
I'm diving into the intimidating world of color darkroom prints (RA-4). I've heard some things (no safelight, needs to be the correct temperature, and so on).
I've shoot some Ilford HP5 + on a Mamiya 645 1000s for the first time. After scanning the negatives i noticed some strange things all over the images, big white dots (most prominent in the sky) like rain.
There are two hard limits on how fast a lens can be: The first is a thermodynamic limit. Then, the infinitesimal area dS on the image plane is conjugated with an infinitesimal portion of the object having a solid-angular size dΩ = dS/f 2.
There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.

Flickr is dying in the Yogi Berra sense: "Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded. " That is, it's lost some of its social media impact because it has become so dilute.

I want to select image sensors for a particular application. One term that I have come across regularly in their datasheets is the CRA.

Look to see what website in Hong Kong uses. China seems to block content with its Great Firewall, sometimes at random and changes policies almost daily.
For an image sensor, CRA relates to the positioning of the microlenses. 0 Deg CRA means the microlenses are centered right on the pixels.
I've been changing lenses with the camera on as long as I've been using DSLRs and I know a lot of other photographers who do the same.
Does anyone know where can I exchange my new Canon lens? I bought it two days ago, but I realized that it is not suitable for me.
As described by FGR's article, sensors with a CRA of 0 have no shifting applied to the pixel microlenses. Sensors with a CRA of X have a micro-lens shift applied to distant pixels in the array designed to match wide-angle lenses with a matching CRA.

What @tenmiles says is correct. I would make two modifications to make this more useful (which is what I played with before).
27mm The vertical angle of view is 27° The horizontal angle of view is 39. 6° The diagonal angle of view is 46. The formula I use in Excel f = focal length d = format dimension (sensor height or width) =((ATAN((d/2/f)))*180/PI())*2 Using the above for a 50mm lens mounted to a 35mm full frame measuring 24mm height by 36mm diagonal measure 43.
So I'm looking at the wikipedia article on Aperture, and I'm a bit confused. I understand aperture to be the diameter of the hole that lets light in.
If you want to hack something, probably the easiest way to do it is to buy a board-level system such as a Raspberry Pi and add a camera module.
Here is a link to a great hack of controlling a Canon 5D mark 2 with a Raspberry PI. It puts the R-PI in a battery/grip so it looks normal.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.
Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?
I'm probably waaaaay too late in answering to help you out with your decision (which I'm sure you've made already) but maybe my answer will help others who have a similar question.
Sorry if the question sounds flippant, it isn't meant to be, and I know that this is asking an opinion rather than a verifiable fact but bear with me...

How many other similar services can you name? they're really few. So, no, I don't think that flickr is dying, considering that they're relatively unique in this business.
If a falling camera gives you the chance, put your foot under it. Doh!). Ah - it wasn't around my neck! (Two cameras around neck, swapping cameras for different shot of dancers.
That is, set your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your ISO (so 1/200th if at ISO 200) and aperture to f/16. Update: Found that there is a Looney 11 rule For astronomical photos of the moon's surface, set aperture to f/11 and shutter speed to the [reciprocal of the] ISO film speed [or ISO setting]."
I have a Canon PowerShot A3100IS digital camera. I was taking pictures but turned it off with the lens still open. I turned it back on, it loaded then made a beeping sound then a black screen came on with white letters stating: Lens error, will shut down automatically, restart camera and it turned off.
Wow, there are so many things that can be affected... Here and here are nice writeups with interactive graphics illustrating the two most common types of SLR autofocus systems.

I have some images of which some look blurry, and the others look non-blurry. I'm trying to analyze the EXIF data of such images in order to determine why some images look blurry and why others don't.
For whatever reason, the ColorSpace tag is not very useful in EXIF. The only standard values are 1 (sRGB) and 65535 ("uncalibrated").
Recently I came across a bunch of weird JPEGs; here's one of them. I have no plans to print these images and I do not have access to Photoshop.

Have a look at "The Photographer's Eye". I found it superb and contains all the rules you can think of. http://www. amazon.
I'm referring to what's listed on Amazon under the configuration. Here's an example: https://www. amazon. com/Tamron-28-75mm-Aspherical-Digital-A09NII/dp/B001955P8W/ref=sr_1_4?
Scott Kelby I also follow Scott Kelby at http://www. scottkelby. com/blog/ I find that (apart from promoting his own training and books - which is not a bad thing) Scott gives a good load of news, and has a weekly guest blogger section, where another famous photographer writes an entry.
In addition to the tips you've listed in comments: Have the owners with the dogs. Dogs are pack animals, and they may be well adjusted but they might not be.
It's a hints and tips book, not a thorough working through of the principals, but I came away from it with a lot of really good solid practical things which I now include in my photography, so I'm sure it would be helpful.

That sounds like a great environment for using a reflector. They are cheap, and it is amazing how much a simple thing like that can change light.
First, clarifying some terms: MOLLE is the modular gear system. 0 MOLLE gear that only uses a singe PALS loop, or 2 adjacent PALS loops, would connect just fine to the Lowepro SlipLock loops.
Scott Kelby has many recipes in his Digital Photography books showing a photo and recipe, how to shoot such photo. I like the books as the tutorials are written in common language and really practical.

Based on @Linwood's excellent answer, I wrote this small Ruby script to recursively scan every lightroom catalog in Pictures folder and stop at the first catalog containing a filename containing 'Hanna'.

The text above Wines seems to read "BAY AND CO" There isn't one algorithm that will always yield the best results, but bicubic interpolation often does well.
Here's a quick and dirty solution with exiftool and cmp: 1) Make copies of the two image files: cp img1. jpg tmp1. jpg cp img2.
This is the solution. It also contains imprivements to the original script. #! /bin/tcsh -f # remove all Umlaute exiftool -L -overwrite_original -api "Filter=s/ä/ae/g;s/ö/oe/g;s/ü/ue/g;s/Ä/Ae/g;s/Ö/Oe/g;s/Ü/Ue/g;s/ß/ss/g" -TagsFromFile @ -all:all .
I am looking for a way to use exiftool to extract the date of creation from the pictures in a directory and just in case they differ, use the earliest date.

You can calculate the resolution from the megapixels like this: ppi = sqrt(mp * 1000000 * 3/2) * 25. 4 / 36 Which gives you: 6 mp = 2117 ppi 7 mp = 2286 ppi 8 mp = 2444 ppi 9 mp = 2592 ppi 10 mp = 2733 ppi 11 mp = 2866 ppi 12 mp = 2993 ppi
I had a script which did something else, but it's easily modifiable to do what you want (at least the initial part): from PIL import Image from PIL.

This is a bug in Corel's implementation of OpenCL Hardware GPU usage. The underlying problem is that Corel's OpenCL implementation shifts the exported layout by 2-pixels (approximately) in X  Y compared to other RAW to JPG (TIF too) conversions.
I would recommend the higher CPU in this case. The 610 is a bare bones "desktop" card that isn't really any better than the 4000.
You can get VirtualBox to give the guest Windows OS access to the GPU via 2D and 3D acceleration. On the VM you wish to use, right click to get the pop-up menu, select Settings, then Display.
From the Darktable manual: darktable-generate-cache --core --cachedir directory I'm not sure what they mean by "when your computer is in idle" – possibly it's just meant to suggest you run this program when you're not otherwise using the CPU?
I noticed that when I'm working with spot healing tool the cursor sometimes wouldn't respond or the brush overlay would stay for few seconds before applying the adjustment.

What processing application do you use ? Its worth checking that it actually uses GPU (graphics processor), not all do.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.
Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?

Flickr is dying in the Yogi Berra sense: "Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded. " That is, it's lost some of its social media impact because it has become so dilute.
How many other similar services can you name? they're really few. So, no, I don't think that flickr is dying, considering that they're relatively unique in this business.
What SHOULD it do A 35 mm f/1. If there is any "give" at the time of impact it will help greatly. Deceleration when dropped onto carpet will vary greatly but the g's experienced by the body are Fall_height / Stopping_distance.
The moon is bathed in full sunshine, so the Sunny 16 rule should give you a good starting point. That is, set your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your ISO (so 1/200th if at ISO 200) and aperture to f/16.
I have a Canon PowerShot A3100IS digital camera. I was taking pictures but turned it off with the lens still open.

for Pentax Cameras, there are two free possibilities: PK_Tether (freeware) which should work with: Pentax k-x, K7, K5, k-r, K20D, K10D, K200 - while the K-x and K-r are entry level, but very good cameras for the price second is pkTriggerCord (opensource) - which is for windows and linux which should fully support Pentax K-x, Pentax K10D (Samsung GX-10), Pentax K20D (Samsung GX-20), Pentax istDS, Pentax K200D, Pentax K-7, Pentax K-r, Pentax K-5, Pentax K-m/K2000 and limited support for istD, istDS2, istDL, K110D, K100D I have Pentax K-x and I am surely going to try both programs :-)
I'm going whale watching with a Pentax K5, I'm thinking of using a Pentax 60-250mm f/4 ED DA* SDM lens only as I don't want to change lenses while out at sea.
I have an old Pentax ME SUPER with three lenses, all of which have manual focus rings and no autofocus motors. Do new Pentax DSLRs have built-in focus motors that can deal with old lenses?

Here are some example dosages; where would looking through the viewfinder for an hour fit? http://xkcd. com/radiation/ I read that lens makers used to use radioactive glass to increase the refractive index property of their lenses.
DA* are top-of-the-line Pentax lenses. According to Pentax, they are the best lenses ever made and they include weather-resistance but the DA* label means a lot more, including ultra-sonic motor and a commitment to excellent quality.
Pentax Lenses Common XYZmm: Focal length 1:x. y: Maximum aperture Focus/Mount Type K, M: Manual Focus, Manual/Aperture priority metering 645: Medium Format mount AF: Early AF system with AF motor and electronics in lens that works only with ME-F body.
It should also be noted that the conversion rate between Rems and Seiverts is 1 mR = 10 µSv. So if a chest x-ray is 10mR (according to the article @rfusca linked), thats about 100µSv.

If you're concerned at max aperture, the 70-200/2. 8 is sharper at f/2.8. http://www. the-digital-picture. com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops.
I do not own either of the two lenses. From experience, I'd say the zoom is the better choice for traveling. The versatility of a single lens providing multiple focal lengths is a key advantage.
You can only avoid it by avoiding to use the small aperture, or by getting a camera with larger sensor (such as a 12MP full frame, which can handle at least ~F11, maybe even F14).
A 70-200 L lens is pretty much epic. com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops. the-digital-picture. Lens=404Camera=453Sample=0FLI=4API=1LensComp=104CameraComp=453SampleComp=0FLIComp=4APIComp=1 280mm: http://www.
I have the Canon 18-135 lens (purchased when I upgraded to the Canon T2i from my Canon XTi). I like the range and the lens weight is certainly convenient.

Take an FF body and a crop body, with similar MP rating - and the FF body will give a sharper image of the same object.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.

I'm probably waaaaay too late in answering to help you out with your decision (which I'm sure you've made already) but maybe my answer will help others who have a similar question.
Sorry if the question sounds flippant, it isn't meant to be, and I know that this is asking an opinion rather than a verifiable fact but bear with me...
Flickr is dying in the Yogi Berra sense: "Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded. " That is, it's lost some of its social media impact because it has become so dilute.
How many other similar services can you name? they're really few. So, no, I don't think that flickr is dying, considering that they're relatively unique in this business.
If a falling camera gives you the chance, put your foot under it. Doh!). Ah - it wasn't around my neck! (Two cameras around neck, swapping cameras for different shot of dancers.

I have a Canon PowerShot A3100IS digital camera. I was taking pictures but turned it off with the lens still open. Any idea on how I would go about restarting the camera or fixing this issue?
Wow, there are so many things that can be affected... Here and here are nice writeups with interactive graphics illustrating the two most common types of SLR autofocus systems.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.

The moon is bathed in full sunshine, so the Sunny 16 rule should give you a good starting point. That is, set your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your ISO (so 1/200th if at ISO 200) and aperture to f/16.

Wow, there are so many things that can be affected... Assuming there is damage (an 18" drop onto carpet isn't likely to have damaged anything, but it's possible) the most likely situation might be a warping of the lens mount so that the mount isn't parallel with the sensor (either the focus sensor or the main imaging sensor).

Of the four Canon zooms I have within arms reach at the moment: I had already noticed it in the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS a long time ago.
The most significant difference between the newer TS-E 50mm f/2. com. 8 at this listing by allphotolenses. There's a small version of the MTF chart released by Canon for the TS-E 45mm f/2.
There's a reason no one makes a 24-200mm FF lens. 5-6. 3 Di II VC is an APS-C only lens. It wouldn't work on your full frame 6D.

Teleconverters can only be used with specific lenses. Budget lenses, even telephoto ones, don't do very well with teleconverters.
There are much more variation between lens lineups designed for mirrorless cameras than DSLRs. 5-5. 6 typical kit lens.
The Tokina 11-16mm f/2. Adapter rings are available to attach a Size L (Z-Pro) filter holder to lenses with filter threads as small as 49mm and as large as 96mm.
A lot depends on which 24-70mm f/2. Ignore the overall scores, they are weighted more for things you (and I) probably aren't as concerned about.
If you only want to carry one lens, and want your new lens to have at least the same capabilities as your kit lens, you have two basic options: a fast zoom, or a superzoom.

The Lensbaby Spark is the lowest priced way to get into a Lensbaby piece of equipment. It is fun and might bring out your creativity.
Suppose you have a folder full of photos that you have taken. The folder contain many photos such as flowers, birds, animals and all kinds of things.
Why would that happen? I was testing spark generation on my car's ignition system at night and recorded the sparks on my Lenovo S856 cell phone.
I wanted to try out the Lensbaby. The initial range has Muse and the Spark. Spark being the newer one has a lot of documentation and reviews on the net and is cheaper too.

Most rumours about "battery memory" are somewhat true for NiCD, NiMH and lead acid batteries. NiMH batteries are still commonly used for flashguns, however they haven't been used as a standard power source for DSLRs for at least 15 years.
Some types of batteries have memory and their effectiveness is reduced if they are not fully charged and then used until fully discharged each time.
You are looking for low discharge rechargeables. Sanyo Enloop are the best known variety of these shelf stable rechargeables, but other brands include: Duracell Rechargeable "Pre-charged" Energizer 'Recharge" Rayovac "Hybrid" Note that some of these brands offer both low discharge and 'regular' so carefully read the label.
Some times I would go about 2~3 months without using my camera. I wonder how can one prolong the life of a digital camera battery.
What you're doing now is fine. Li-ion does not need to be fully charged for storage. In fact, the best state to store them in is between 30-70% charge, but I'd probably only bother with that if storing them for many months.

I'm wondering if I should bring extra batteries (CR123) with me. It's usually a good idea to bring extra batteries. However, if you forget or lose them, CR123 are common enough that you should be able to find replacements somewhere.
Usually the rating is on the sticker on the bottom of the camera or in the manual. The problem with battery life in a lot of Canon cameras is that the batteries can be rated at 750mAh and the camera at 1000mAh.
