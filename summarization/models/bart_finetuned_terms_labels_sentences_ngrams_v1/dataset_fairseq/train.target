In my reading today, I came across this phrase: Pardon the mixed metaphor, but you’ve brought a knife to a gun fight. [Link] The (longtime) columnist was saying the person was outmatched.
Charles Mackay, A Glossary of Obscure Words and Phrases in the Writings of Shakspeare and His Contemporaries (1887) has an interesting but rather lengthy entry for "Brown study," parts of which I reproduce (with annotations) below: Brown study.
As the other answers say, in South Africa there is a lot of Afrikaans speakers, and Dutch is quite frequently known too.
If you wanted to refer to a specific accent you'd have to refer to the name of the area (i.e. Dublin accent, Cork accent, Midlands accent, etc.
I used to say zoo-ology until I came across words like zoological and zoogeography. For example, Random House Unabridged shows only [zoh-ol-uh-jee] and Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary shows only (zoʊˈɒl ə dʒi) Furthermore in Cambridge Dictionary the pronunciation for UK English is given as /zu/-ology while the American pronunciation is given as /zoʊ/-ology.

The Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language describes the situation as follows (it's mostly concerned with the orthography, however, not the phonology): [T is] elided after s following a stressed vowel: before /l/, especially in the terminal syllable -le, as in castle, nestle, pestle, trestle, wrestle, [...
The verb fuddle, attested in the OED since 1588, means to muddle the mind with strong drink. Fuddled originally meant intoxicated and later grew to mean muddled or confused.
Not really, no. All English spoken today has changed somewhat since the 17th Century, and for as long as we know there have always been many different English accents.

The usages that you mention all work slightly differently. Symmetrically, to say ‘I have no time for [someone]’ is to dismiss that person as not being worth spending effort on.
According to the answer sheet, the blank is to be filled by using the word harmful, which (to me) makes very little, if any, sense at all in this structure.
The following is my initial attempt to answer your final question. Y = can be reduced N = can't be reduced ? Others may find it needs correcting / adjusting.
To be certainly can, because it has its existential meaning, as well as its copulative meaning. To painfully be, not to painfully be.

This question or a similar one may have been answered here before. But I couldn't find an answer. So I'm going to ask how the grammarians here would punctuate the following sentence: "The author argued that his results differed from previous results because the methods he used differed from the methods that previous researches used and his sample came from a different part of the world than the samples that those researchers used.

Position of question mark when sentence doesnt end with question Take this statement for example: That's not the question.
Snow pellets can also occur when a snowflake melts about half way then refreezes as it falls. Snow pellets have characteristics of hail, sleet and snow.
a light, brief shower of snow. Flurries usually produce little accumulation (Definition from American Meteorological Society and National Snow and Ice Data Centre).
Hail is also ice pellets, but they are produced by a different meteorological process, and can occur any time of year. This often happens when it starts raining, and then becomes cold enough to snow, or vice versa.

How is the spelling of a hyphenated word usually read out loud? For example, with "Anglo-Saxon", do we say: "It is spelt as A&mdash;N&mdash;G&mdash;L&mdash;O&mdash;dash&mdash;S&mdash;A&mdash;X&mdash;O&mdash;N.

I would tend to put the description of the vector before the word vector, and the name of the vector after the word vector.
Iterate over what? I guess that is the point. To 'iterate' is to repeat something, say, an action, so we can iterate a procedure, or we can iterate over x, or iterate through x.

I'm not sure if I should call it "cache partition technique" or "cache partitioning technique". My intuition told me I should use "cache partitioning technique" but I'm not that sure.
I've sometimes seen this construct, used to avoid repetitive handwriting, but I don't even know if it's proper English.
Both options that you are considering are unclear. In other words, each of the two is unclear. To be perfectly clear, say: The datasets HapMap 6 and CEU HapMap 610 are each stored in an individual schema.
The key is the word macroscopic. Individual particles within compressible fluids may have velocities that differ from the macroscopic velocity.

I'm writing an automobile website and some of my paragraphs contain the word "only". 6-litre/124bhp and 1. 8-litre/132bhp engines.
Looking on the Corpus of Contemporary American English for dawdle, and comparing the result with what reported by the British National Corpus, I would say that the word is not so common in American English, but it is used more in American English than in British English.
Cane sugar comes from sugarcane. Sugarcane is the crop, cane sugar is the refined grains of sugar. Edit: you also get other things from sugarcane, such as falernum, molasses, rum, cachaça, bagasse and ethanol.

If you have something like: Get the name(s) of all users. Anyone know what is the proper way? The way I see it, each user has only one name, so it could be singular, but you will be getting many names, one for each users, so it could also be plural.
I can make this work grammatically, but you REALLY have to squint at it. This is comparable with the famous buffalo sentence.

Are there any specific rules for articles before the word zero? Thanks! "a zero magnetization" or "the zero magnetization" or "zero magnetization"?
The answer may depend on the first language. The way you think of the situation. Prepositions are always subjective. Firstly know the connection between subject and landmark Here the subject is Sheila and landmark is facebook.
Zero is can be used to indicate a counted quantity whereas null cannot. In math you can have a set with no items in it (a null set) or you can have a set with a zero in it ({ 0 }) which are not the same.
Telling a person to repeat something they have said sounds better to me, but is it more correct to ask them to resay what they said?

A word you might consider, albeit it rather literary, is quotidian: Ordinary or everyday; mundane: his story is an achingly human one, mired in quotidian details ODO Your "stationery, coffee mugs, bags" and the like are quotidian needs.

"Brother/sister-in-law" is common U.S. English usage to refer to the spouses of your spouse's siblings. I have four brothers-in-law -- my sister's husband, my husband's brother, and my husband's sisters' husbands.
The sister to a husband becomes the wife's sister-in-law. If the sister in-law was to marry a woman, would she also become the wife's sister-in-law?

So basically, my mom recently remarried to a man with one daughter from a previous marriage. Obviously, she's my step-sister.
He is your brother-in-law. There has already been a similar question posted here to which the answer was "sister-in-law", so I'll finish the list here: Your spouse's brother or your sister's husband is your brother-in-law.
If you only have one sister and she is younger than you, she is your younger/little/baby sister. If you have several sisters, it gets more complicated: The sisters closest to you in age, but younger, are your younger/little sisters.
The answer to this can be viewed from a logic process. The sibling of a spouse is by relation the brother or sister of the spouse, and by marital assignment the brother or sister - in - law to the spouses marriage partner.
There's no single word for this in English. You can call this person your 'grandmother-in-law' or your spouse's grandmother, but it is not widely understood to mean that.

I haven't seen someone offer the word anal (or anal-retentive): The term anal-retentive (also anally retentive), commonly abbreviated to anal, is used conversationally to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that the obsession becomes an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person.
Someone who is "anal retentive" is a good fit and conveys the speaker's annoyance quite effectively. Wikipedia describes it thus: The term anal retentive (also anally retentive), commonly abbreviated to anal, is used to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that the obsession becomes an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person. .
Etymonline states: Anal-retentive first attested 1957, in psychological jargon. According to Wikipedia, which does a much more thorough job of explaining than I will, the term comes from the psychological work of Dr.
You are correct. They staged an interview where he pretended to be Sigmund Freud. Given that he doesn't mention a script, it seems that he was considered to be such an expert on Freud that it was felt he could play the part and answer questions as if he, himself, were Freud.
It's Freud. He classified those as 2 of 5 steps in psychological development. ps. If Freud ain't your style then Nabokov probably isn't either...

As a noun, pillage means the same as the verb, in other words, it is synonymous with 'the act of pillaging', except when used as a category in an accounting table.
A couple of colleagues and I have been going through some Google NGrams. At first it seems quite conclusive that plundering is a far more sea worthy activity than pillaging, and plundering is certainly the more pirately thing to do: In an actual example: British critic: and quarterly theological review, Volume 16 (pp.

The following are correct. This is his pencil. / This is my pencil. The following are wrong. This pencil is his. / This pencil is mine.
Thus, "Wet Floor" is a better caution than "Slippery Floor". "Wet Floor" is easier to translate into other languages than "Slippery Floor".
I have the tendency to equate "mine" as something like "hers" and "his". But I am not sure if this is correct. Which is correct?

Atom is a countable noun. Hydrogen is a mass noun. Hydrogen does not have the same meaning as hydrogen atom. Hydrogen atom is another way to say atom of hydrogen (just like ice cube is another way to say cube of ice).
What is the type (adjective, noun, etc. ) of the word atom in hydrogen atom? I think that atom here does not qualify hydrogen in any way and we can use it or not, and the meaning of the word hydrogen will not change.
Kinship terms in English begin with the first common direct ancestors. It gets a bit tricky when people are of different generations.

- confinement in a jail: she was sentenced to three months' jail. The NOAD reports the following definitions: jail /dʒeɪl/ ( British also gaol) noun a place for the confinement of people accused or convicted of a crime: he spent 15 years in jail | [as adjective] a jail sentence.
The terms are synonymous in British English. Though it still gets used a lot in conversation. And incidentally, the term inmate for prisoner is officially deprecated in the UK.
To be clearer, state the relationship between "crime in X" and "causal chain" in your caption, and use a full sentence.

Here's one I only recently learned I was saying wrong all my life. The name of children's book author Dr. Seuss It does NOT rhyme with Goose.
Sandhi, borrowed from the Sanskrit word meaning joining, is the linguistic term used to refer to phonological changes that occur at morpheme boundaries (internal sandhi) or word boundaries (external sandhi).
I assume you're talking about the passage at http://plato. stanford. Obviously, the exact extent of the 'inviolate personality' versus the 'public personality' is something rather vague, and a lot of time is spent in courts and governments concerning the protection of these privacies.
But what's the exact meaning of sphere here? And what's the pattern for the use of this kind of sphere? Reading a journal article, I encountered these terms: customer sphere of privacy customer sphere of security privacy sphere of implementation security sphere of implementation I know the rough meaning is: privacy connected with the customer, and so on.

I think "time zone" is most common. 6 million results, but timezone -"time zone" gives only 6. 3 million. Google backs me up in this case - googling "time zone" -timezone (that is, websites with only time zone in them) gives 12.
Odorous? (Odourous in the UK) (Same in the UK, see below) Scented if the smell was added (Strawberry-scented envelopes, but not scented strawberries) or smelly if the smell is pungent or unpleasant (smelly cheese can be good, smelly socks aren't).
As a spin-off from this comment: If a human exclaims something like "ouch! ", I believe it's considered an interjection.
I would like to know when I attach my signature in my email. Which type of regards I should choose? Best Regards, Drew, Lim Chee Lim Best Regards, Drew, Lim C.
There seem to be three spellings: timezone, time-zone, and time zone. [^2] At the same time, timezone is the favored spelling in the US (unless talking about multiple time zones).

I've recently encountered the term "Pedestrianised Zone" (as part of the name of a pedestrian zone, as in "X Street Pedestrianised Zone") and thought there's something weird/grammatically wrong about it.
I know this is true for German and Spanish: Morgen morgen and Mañana por la mañana both mean "tomorrow morning". There may well be other examples too.

quote, letter, parenthesis, bracket, sic, correction, local, mercy, original, jinx
So: "... " or "... " This is not the most common usage for recte, but I think it would convey the message. The conventional way is the following: "...

What is the proper use of [square brackets] in quotes? Parentheses or square brackets? When I add information beside a word in a Bible verse, what bracket should I use?

I think people are just being accurate. When they know the tumors in their lungs are cancerous, they accurately refer to it as "lung cancer" or "cancer of the lung".
The definition of irony can be so elusive. Let's examine the two pieces of your example: Linux is the most secure OS. Linux is used for the most effective hacking.
The link to Torvalds' pronunciation is broken, but I have it on my hard drive. It is a quote from Torvalds himself (I meant Himself, sorry).

In my CV, I have a line that says: OSs: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux Is there a word (that a human could understand) that laconically says that I am able to work on all OSs?
If you want to keep the sentence as close to the original as possible you would at least need to add an article in front of the word "tumor.
Using a CMS, I found the following description for a user setting. If checked, this user will be granted "vetted" status.
To me, Linux-dependent does not sound quite right. Instead, I would say Linux-only software. For example GNOME Discusses Becoming a Linux-only Project The word dependency makes me think of a required library but a platform or OS is more than that.
I think the fellatio notion is quite clear: Suck: Meaning "do fellatio" is first recorded 1928. Slang sense of "be contemptible" first attested 1971 (the underlying notion is of fellatio).

Nausea, by itself, is the urge to vomit. I had really bad nausea. Nauseated is the verb meaning to become affected with nausea.
From Wikipedia: A zigzag is a pattern made up of small corners at variable angles, though constant within the zigzag, tracing a path between two parallel lines; it can be described as both jagged and fairly regular.
I don't quite understand how one should use the expression "exported from somewhere". What does it mean when an item is exported from a given place?
According to http://www. thefreedictionary. I agree, it does sound better; but, naturally, disable is used as a verb. Hence "disable time" suggests that a subject is trying to disable time (whatever that means).
If you are asking about the sentence Does this also mean that if exports increase and nothing happens to imports, will that lead to Net Exports increasing?

Meth (or sometimes crystal meth) means methamphetamine. It is the most common name for the drug, at least in the US. A meth head is someone who uses meth.
Dyad is commonly used for pairs of things. Here is a dyad of definitions: Dictionary online and Webster's historical dictionaries There's a whole set of related words with increasing valence: monad, dyad, triad, tetrad, pentad, hexad, etc.
queasy means suffering from nausea, a stomach distress with distaste for food and an urge to vomit. "... if I eat any more meat, I'd vomit.

Surely the discussion here is not about what is correct, it is just labeling. Soured Cream simply means it has been soured (made sour), past tense.
Looking at the Corpus of Contemporary American English, I notice that the most used phrase is sour cream. Looking at the entry for sour (the verb) in the NOAD, I find the following definition: make or become sour: [with object]: water soured with tamarind | (as adjective soured): soured cream | [without object]: a bowl of milk was souring in the sun.
Ok, if I say "this car is too expensive" or "this car is very expensive", then I can not express the connotation of "expensive".
Emit and radiate are both good candidates, Emit (v): to throw or give off or out (as light or heat) Radiate (v): to send out in or as if in rays while emanate could be used to describe what the heat itself is doing (although it is sometimes used incorrectly to mean emit.
"Seething breeding" is not an idiom, although you can find the two words together on occasion. I think the problem you may be having is in parsing the words next to seething breeding.

Edit: I'm adding three more examples with "as". The same question as above. (D) My system is expensive, as yours would be.

Earphones/earbuds are those worn in the ears without a headband. While they come in pairs, one can have an earphone/earbud in one ear, leaving the other dangling.
Can you wear headphones (plural) in only one ear? Or would I have to use a singular form? EDIT: I want to show that even though she has a set of headphones, she's only wearing a singular piece of it in one ear.

As fumblefingers mentions, the answer to the question is contextual. Nevertheless, phrases I've used in the past to point out that I am not in favour of whatever misstep the recipient of my missive has allowed themselves: Disappointed, MSS Affronted, MSS Disapprovingly, MSS Disparagingly, MSS et ad nauseam...
If there is a noun, then parenthesis or a comma, where should a 's go? For example: The dog (who was very big)'s ears perked up.
I found this when learning underscore. js (a programming framework). The introduction says: It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
It has several possible names. Earpiece is a holdover from (in electronic terms) ancient times of land lines where you had a phone that was attached by a wire in the wall.
Alternatively, you can tell someone he has nothing between the ears. (TFD) If you say someone has nothing between their ears, you are saying they are stupid, that they have no brain.

The most common ways I've seen are writing out the words: sad trombone :( trombone Or to use the onomatopoeic Wah, Wah, Wah, Wahhhhhhh … Womp, Womp, Womp, Wommmmmp… (at the behest of several commenters) Or to combine them: sad trombone: wah, wah, wah, wahhhhh …
" ? is it possible? Thanks in advance :) I think these two questions are ok to use with Should  Shouldn't and it's same meaning can you tell me why to do?
We have a word for telling something that is not truthful, a.k.a. to lie, but why is there no conjugatable term for telling the truth?
Is a question that starts with "What need is there to" grammatically correct? If so, is there a difference in meaning or nuance between that clause and "Is there a need to"?

What is the plural form of “iPad 2”? When can an adjective be postposed? I'm curious particularly with iPod Touch and iPad Mini The plural would be iPod Touches and iPad Minis, or iPods Touch and iPads Mini
If you are a tenant, you would be "renting" an apartment. If you are a landlord, you would be "letting" an apartment. Sometimes landlords will use the word "rent.
I am confused about the usage of the words like and unlike in sentences. Like and unlike make me confused because I see them being used everywhere almost interchangeably, and to make matters worse I even saw commas making difference in meaning.

We are translating the great OpenStreetMap editor JOSM to Hungarian and arguing on the translation of "map tile". Some of us state that it should be literally translated, because map tile and map section are different things, map tile being an online, scalable form of a map section.

Having found the publication you referenced, I noticed two words that you left out that clear up the sentence a bit. ) In (somewhat) plain English: Take the property that is subject to nonrecourse debt and find the Fair Market Value.
Quite simply "not in excess". Since excess means: An amount of something that is more than necessary, permitted, or desirable: and in excess means: Exceeding the proper amount or degree (from ODO) So if something is in excess then it is more than sufficient.
Modern English has changed the way we say "sneak". Nowadays, the word "snuck" is used in many phrases and books. Which one is the correct verb to use in this phrase?
First, I am assuming this is a definition of a type of debt or an explanation of a value. Ok. X is: the FMV of the property subject to Y Y is: the nonrecourse debt to the extent [that] Z is forgiven.

I have a program that does a job on batches of 100 items. I'd like a single word for the batches of batches. I'm not looking for just any old synonym of "batch", but for a word which includes the sense of being batched at a higher level - though if such a word doesn't exist for "batch" and does exist for a synonym, I'd be happy with the pair.

I remember hearing once about the etymology of disgruntled, probably based around a joke about how people can not be gruntled.
The story is a long one, too long to be told here. The OED has six separate entries for the prefix a-. One use, for example, is as a variant of the y-prefix, which in turn has its origins in ge-, the prefix used in some Germanic languages to indicate perfective or completive meaning.
In the following sentence: While it is best to use a recipe designed for a big batch, using a multiplied by three small-batch recipe is no more probable to fail than using the small-batch recipe for a single small batch, probable is the head of the adjectival phrase, probable to fail, which qualifies the noun phrase using a ...

primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, denary, duodenary, etc. Currently I'm considering replacing word_or_phrase with higher-order, higher-tier or n-ary, with the intended meaning of "from tertiary onwards".
Here is something I was able to discover on the internet the prime time I confronted the same predicament as you. These come from the Latin roots.
What are the rules (if any) to form the adjective meaning n-ary (in group of n)? When referring to numbers between 0 and 10, the -ary adjectives are: 0 - nullary 1 - unary 2 - binary 3 - ternary 4 - quaternary 5 - quinary 6 - senary 7 - septenary 8 - octonary or octary 9 - novenary or nonary 10 - decenery or denary Can this sequence be continued?
any of the numbers that express amount, as one, two, three, etc. Naturally, in the right contexts, these have been shorted to "cardinals" and "ordinals", i.e.
Here we wish to make sure the usage of ... number(s) of ... , which one below is correct? An even number of people An even number of cards Even numbers of people Even numbers of cards An odd number of people An odd number of cards Odd numbers of people Odd numbers of cards Six numbers of people Six numbers of cards Six number of people Six number of cards A six number of people A six number of cards

Common Digits Although it was not always this way, at one point in the history of the Unicode Standard, they made explicit that a digit was only usable for a base-10 numeric character used to compose big-endian numbers.
No, an emoticon is a symbol, not punctuation. Unicode clearly differentiates symbols such as math symbols and currency symbols, from punctuation, such as open or close punctuation.
Obviously the word "sign" is countable noun in this context. One sign. Two signs. But NO SIGN means zero sign. I'd like to say: The calm, balmy evening air showed no sign of the carnage that would ensue.
Programmers have been known to call it ‘hook’. Edit: Modern programmers have a lot more hooky things to cope with than just the old QUESTION MARK from antediluvian typewriter keyboards.

They do not mean the same (to finally answer the original question). The question is confusing since both the odd's bodkins and bare bodkin appear in Shakespeare's Hamlet.
Yes, this is grammatical. The first noun is acting like an adjective. As Colin notes, you can't always put a noun in a the same position as an adjective bu it does work as 'N N'.
How about "begrudging toleration"? "Toleration" already implies that there is something negative (them being Jewish in your example) that you have to accept for whatever reason (you don't like them but the authority tells you to; you don't like them but they have something you want; c.).

This is a matter of personal preference and/or a style guide, but here's what I recall from one usage authority (The Right Word at the Right Time, published by the Reader's Digest).
What you need to think about here is what it is that there are five of. If you look at a sentence like five cans of paint for example, there are five cans.
Is there a prescribed way or a widely practised method of transcribing long repeating phone numbers? I always have this problem of telling people my phone number which consists of a series of repeating numbers: 184 555 5555 (DO NOT CALL, this is just as an example) I can tell people it is: one eight four, five five five, five five five five, or; one eight four, five, double five, double five, double five, or; one eight four, five, triple five, triple five, or; one eight four, five, sextuple five.
A good adjective is scheming for the person you describe. given to making plans, especially sly and underhand ones; crafty.
0. 05. 002, that number would be uttered as "two thousandths"; and 0. As Jasen asked and Zack answered, you have to be careful.

I have a friend who says sentences like, "Santa Claus deserves booed". I would say, "Santa Claus deserves to be booed".
If corpus evidence is anything to go by, then Santa Claus is more popular than Father Christmas in the US, and Father Christmas is more popular than Santa Claus in the UK, but by a very much smaller degree.
Santa Claus is a man, right? In this case, he may not be fine with the fact that people call him Santa, which is the Spanish and Portuguese word for female saint names.

I'm not a native English speaker, but I would like to know how and why people started using mother fucker. I know we see it in the movies sometimes, but did people call each other mother fuckers 100 years ago?

Some computer programming languages have a whole family of int types: bare int, unsigned short int, long int, and so on.
"The" refers to a specific instance or sample of quinine bark. If you were in the lab and saw a pile of quinine bark you might say to a colleague "I'm going to run a test on the quinine bark," but to the rest of the world there is just quinine bark in general, which is (presumably) what the research hinges on.
How about ‘server address’? You could somewhere early in the document define that ‘server address’ denotes the concatenation ‘servername-hostname-port’ and then always refer to it as ‘server address’.

Or bear-trap memory? Any why "bear trap"? I googled and saw a few examples. But none is very explanatory. An example of usage: ...
Its called a Trap. Trap house can be a house or club or building that hosts delinquents or druggies. Also make and sell drugs from these traps.
If "an unsprung trap" can mean "a trap not fitted with springs" and also "a trap which has not activated", then generally the second would be the more pertinent information and the more likely meaning, unless you're having a discussion with a trap maker, in which case, well, sometimes things are just ambiguous.
If you really have to say it so directly you could, depending on the context, say 'mind your own beeswax', the word 'beeswax' was apparently slang for a bore back in the 19th Century.
They are two different terms altogether. Automata theory refers to a subject in the theory of computation Automaton theory refers to a concept in psychology There are occurrences of 'automaton theory' in biology and quantum mechanics too.

What does it refer to in its raining? Whence the it in I like it here? What is the grammatical term for the 'it' in forms such as "It is raining" or "It won't matter", and is there a difference between the usage in those two examples?
or You can contact John, Jane or myself for more information ... When is it correct to use yourself and myself (versus you and me)?

Your grammar is fine, and the sentence was perfectly understandable to me, even before you provided more context. I admit that it is a bit convoluted, though, so many readers would have to stop and re-read the sentence before they could make sense of it.
The two-sentence rewrite Nexisa resolved not to give up until she had achieved her dreams. Her determination was stronger than ever.

To summarize: Urban dictionary is not very reliable. specifically, the example there of implying reverse psychology, is not defining, but rather a very incidental use.
Drug A is administered concurrently with or sequentially to Drug B. I want to say in a formal manner that Drug A and Drug B are administered either at the same time or at different times, but I don’t want to say whether A or B comes first.
I googled "Gravy Etymology" and found this link which says that "gravy is a subset of sauces made from meat essence" and it goes on to say that Italian-Americans use the word to refer to tomato-and-meat sauce.
[Gravy] is an Italian American invention. I also found at Serious Eats, Sunday gravy: anyone have a great recipe for it?
In the addictive drug context you mention, the phrase is "quit cold turkey. " It means to stop taking an addictive drug and to withstand the effects of drug withdrawal without the use of that drug or any other drug to treat or lessen the effects.

I hope you understand. I think "Impressions of drug usage in developing countries" will be more apt. This means the impressions are about the drug usage in developing countries.
You're not "doing drugs" if Aderall is part of your medical treatment for ADHD. You might be described as "doing drugs" if you regularly take Aderall for recreational purposes.

Simply stick with the pronoun you would have used if the statement was made about your action and your action alone. For example if you will say: Juan gave a present to Ana and I gave a present to Ana.
It means “mastery of Google” or “Googling skill”. ORIGIN from Chinese gōngfú, from gōng ‘merit’ + fú ‘master.’ It is modelled after kung fu: kung fu (noun): a primarily unarmed Chinese martial art resembling karate.
When I write, I would not use any of these “[pronoun] too,” and I would write Juan gives a present to Ana, and so do I.
I believe in this context "fu" or "foo" means skill, power or magic - as in kung-fu, or "my Google-foo is not working today".
The skill is known as Google-fu, and is a noun. So although you can't use it as a straight adjective (ie 'he is Google-fu'), you can say 'his Google-fu is very impressive'.

Spiderman is not an ordinary word while punisher is. People will know that a punisher is someone who punishes, but what in the world is a spiderman?
High is indeed the collocation of choice here. Big or large don't sound idiomatic. Both the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) and the British National Corpus (BNC) confirm this.
Brie, the cheese, is a proper noun in France, where the use of the term is defined by law; elsewhere it’s a common noun.

Here you can see asparagine and aspartic acid as example: Asparagine (Asn) Aspartic acid (Asp) Aspartic and glutamic acid include a carboxylic acid (-COOH), whereas asparagine and glutamine are carboxamides (-CO-NH2).
The same is true for amination. Exceptions do exist, of course. For example, Not all transaminations involve glutamate/glutamine (as this user has replied), and serine and threonine can be directly deaminated (via dehydratase enzymes, as opposed to the dehydrogenase used for glutamate).
Even the GABA aminotransferase employs glutamate/α-ketoglutarate. It seems that all transaminases use glutamate/α-ketoglutarate; in fact most of them do.

-) at neutral pH. +). You are not correct that the groups are truly neutral. The carboxyl group is negatively charged in a solution much higher than the pKa of the carboxyl group (which is pH 2.
Amino acids with non‐ionizable side chains are zwitterions when they are at physiological pH, pH 7.4. This is what my book says.
When exposed to acid, these groups would hydrolyse, releasing ammonia. This method, however, fails to distinguish asparagine/aspartate and glutamine/glutamate due to their acid-unstable nature.
In dogs,eumelanin consists of molecules of DHI and DHICA. DHI and DHICA are made from dopachrome. When TYRP1 has a mutation through which it loses its function, mostly DHI is produced which gives brown eumelanin.

Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, "together", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, "sensation") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.

Looks like I solved it by using PICARD: extracting the aligned reads but without sorting, I used java -jar picard. jar SamToFastq I=file_alnMAP.
This script, named blast2table. pl is from the code accompanying the Blast book by Korf  Yandell (there is a 3rd author whom I haven't met).
fa reads. fastq | samtools sort -o output. bam - Optionally using multiple threads: bwa mem -t 8 genome. fa reads. fastq | samtools sort -@8 -o output.
As a fuller explanation, use bedtools with the intersect command: bedtools intersect -u -a variantList. vcf -b exonicRegions.
Found the solution. You just need to pipe the output from bwa mem into samtools view like so bwa mem ref. fa in. fq | samtools view -bS -  out.

34-48 2012 We have attempted such crosses many times and they almost always success in terms of seedpod development. We have attempted such crosses nearly 100 times without success.
What mechanisms best explain this increase in fertility of odd ploidy and viability of aneuploids as ploidy levels increase?
The genus Rhododendron has been divided into some 900 plus species. Often these species hybridize in nature creating what are called hybrid swarms.
Depending on the species the hability of generating hybrids will be different. Some can, others don't. I don't know specifically on the Orchids though.

I have some fragments of DNA from single and double digests using three different restriction enzymes. The map needs indicate the relative positions of the restriction sites along with distances from the ends.
From Schonman (2013): ... allele A can only invade under Hamilton’s condition R=$F_{ST}$ > C/B. From Harpending (2002): The best general definition of the coefficient of relation $R_{XY}$ between individuals X and Y is (Bulmer, 1994) $R_{XY}$ = $F_{XY}$/$F_{XX}$, where $F_{XY}$ is the kinship between X and Y and $F_{XX}$ is the kinship of X with himself [..
4kb and 1. The analytical digestion used Promega EcoRI and BamHI in Buffer Multi-Core, which Promega claims offers 75-100% efficiency for both enzymes.
the same location ? What would you do if you want to remove an EcoRI restriction site and introduce BamHI restriction site at apprx.
I would go with BamH1 enzyme as the cut site in pBr322 is BamHI 375 and ss you are plating it in a ampicillin plate you need the ampicillin resistant gene to be intact for screening so by using BamHI you will not disrupt the Amp resistant gene

Because of the Orbicularis oris muscle, it's a complex of muscles in the lips that encircles the mouth, It forms the greater part of the substance of the lips, lying between the skin and the mucus membrane, and extending from the edge of each lip to its root.
Wikipedia gives a very good explanation of this, on the page for the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In the fruit fly model there are five players: CLK, CYC, PER, TIM, CRY.
In meiosis, homologous recombination occurs. Two Spo11 proteins utilize tyrosines to induce a double-stranded break in the DNA.

Sleep occurs in stages. If your alarm goes off while you are in the middle of deep sleep, you are going to feel different from if you had woken up naturally.
Sleep-walking is a mixture of NREM and wakefulness. Mahowald, M. W. ,  Schenck, C. H. (2005). Nature, 437(7063), 1279–85.
And how it is raised again during the latter stages of sleep? There is an arousal threshold during sleep that only when it is overcome will it wake a person up.
And these different stages may play different roles in 'rejuvenating' the body (as you put it). Interesting note: There are people who have tried a method called polyphasic sleep, where they nap/sleep periodically and regularly, instead of sleeping once a day for 8 hours, say.
Keep in mind that colder enviromental tempratures significantly attenuated METH-induced neurotoxicity Could the reason as to why 7-NI prevents METH induced neurotoxicity and dopamine depletion simply be because it oxidizes dopamine oxidizer peroxynitrite noting that non-meth induced hyperthermia also cause neurotoxicity and produces peroxynitrite while showing the same neurotoxicity markers as METH induced neurotoxicity such as nitrotyrosine?

4]: rem-behavior disorder 1]. References: [Ref. 2]. 4]. 3]. [Ref. I do question your reasoning that the combination of these two parasomnias would result in being: consciously aware of yourself and your surroundings while you are also unconsciously moving about, outside of your conscious control.
I've had this happen before also, along with the "jolting" out of it you describe. It usually happens when I'm very tired and trying to stay awake.
I did a quick search and found some research in this area. In a review article by Patricia Tassi, Alain Muzet (Sleep inertia.
People can dream, dogs can dream, cats probably too when they are sleeping. What about other creatures? Can a bird dream?

While the heart is affected during septic shock, it is the result of the chain of events that occur as a result of a systemic release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) that leads to the "collapse of the circulatory and respiratory system.
They include, in the case of accidental necrosis, HMGB1, IL-1a, uric acid, DNA fragments, mitochondrial content, and ATP (Tables 1and2)(Eigenbrod et al.
This is quite a big question! The influx and efflux reach an equilibrium at the Nernst potential, where the electrical and chemical forces equal out.
Immunosurveillance of cancer cells is predicated upon multiple "signals" derived from the cancerous cells and their microenvironment.

Neuroendocrine systems can be defined as the sets of neurons, glands and non-endocrine tissues, and the neurochemicals, hormones, and humoral signals they produce and receive, that function in an integrated manner to collectively regulate a physiological or behavioral state.
There's no rule that says a transcription factor must be either a repressor or an activator. Expression of cI is initially dependent on a different promoter (PRE), but I won't get into this here.
Two main types of action potentials occur in the heart . Therefore, there is a large gradient that favors efflux of K+ from the cell.

I am not a chemist and unfortunately I will have to refer to wikipedia, but the ionization constant for HF (10−3. 15, according to wikipedia) does not take homo-association into account.

I read in this New Scientist report, that the mental decline during diabetes may be an early stage of Alzheimer's. The hypothesis was based on a study with 20 rats.
Carnivorous plants release digestive enzymes to digest their prey or have other adaptations specifically to pull nutrients from the things they kill.

I am interested in learning about GMO. The topic is so wrapped in controversy, that it's hard to find a good book that introduces the basic concepts involved.
Preamble. Examples that contradict this hypothesis: Gorillas have no natural predators or prey but have a very similar sensory setup to ours that helps social bonds.
Perhaps someone can give you an example sound file and/or a spectrogram representation of it. Copied from my comment: It just means a sound that starts at a low frequency and goes up to a higher frequency like a whistle sound.

No it isn't necessary to breathe in CO2 from the atmosphere. No outside CO2 is needed. Your kidneys also play a similar role but the lungs are what provide a rapid response.

In my own opinion, I would not classify this as parasitism, as more unpalatable species are eaten with Batesian mimicry (and eating causes death).
Keeping in mind that I know nothing about this, I will try to explain why the hand can be modelled with 27 degrees of freedom.
In Stathos and Fishman (2014), the authors refer to the concept of structural underdominance. The first time they mention it is in the first paragraph of the second page (left column) and the term is followed by some kind of definition in parenthesis.

119). This can then lead to unbalanced gametes with low viability, which means low fitness compared to homozygotes. If I have understood the process correctly, chromosomal doubling should lead to better pairing of chromosomes and lower risk of unbalanced chromosome translocations.
What does genetic variance mean in (A)? does it imply that environmental factors are at play Yes and other things. For more information, have a look at Why is a heritability coefficient not an index of how “genetic” something is?
There are two criteria to differ between flexion and extension: 1) Decreasing or increasing the angle between the involved bones.
No it isn't necessary to breathe in CO2 from the atmosphere. No outside CO2 is needed. For the buffer system your brain detects the amount of CO2 (H+ which is an indicator of excess or too little CO2) and adjusts your breathing automatically to compensate so that your blood's pH stays normal.
Preamble. This would just obscure the actual important physical aspects of the sensory input values. Other meerkats immediately hide when hearing this signal (interestingly, this call is mimicked by Drongos who steal the meerkat food that is abandoned in the panic) before checking if a predator is present.

So, when we say that our blood pressure is 180mmhg, it's wrong. In reality, the blood pressure is (180+760)mmHg inside the blood vessel, and our blood pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure by 180mmhg.
I know it must be highest in the arteries. arteries>capillaries>veins Arteries: 120-80mmHg (systolic - diastolic). What are the typical systolic and diastolic blood pressure in arteries,capillaries, veins and the heart?
For further investigation into the progress of the blood pressure, we will measure a patient's blood pressure in the superior vena cava measured during inhalation and during an exhalation.
My study materials use the word vesselcompression chamber of aorta to emphasize aorta's elastic property. The arch of the aorta only coils, not its straight part.
I am confused regarding the presence of valves in the superior vena cava. The superior vena cava does not possess valves unlike inferior vena cava, which possesses Eustachian Valve.

This period is called period of isovolumic contraction. Take a look at the phonocardiogram linked in Majid's answer. Isovolumic Relaxation: The reverse happens in isovolumic relaxation.
This makes sense because P = F/A, the surface area of the heart is smaller when it is contracted versus when it is relaxed, hence greater pressure.

Short answer Walnuts are classified both as nuts and drupes ('stone fruits'). background According to University of Wisconsin - Madison, Department of Botany , hickory and walnut can be classified both as drupes and nuts, but are best classified as nuts.
We've been learning about fruits (and the various categories thereof) in class; among them we have the nut and the drupe.
I've read on this publication that every drug that induces CYP3A can reduce the effectiveness of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin inhibits CYP3A.

You've misread the paper. Clarithromycin is metabolized in part by CYP3A, but to an active metabolite. A significant proportion of clarithromycin and its active metabolites are excreted unchanged in the kidney.
This page indicates that the first two days is "very early" for a zygote to split, and that conjoined twins are the result of an "extremely late" split: If the zygote splits very early (in the first 2 days after fertilization) they may develop separate placentas (chorion) and separate sacs (amnion). ...

The mechanism given by the OP is renowned in the world of pharmacology and drug-receptor interactions, and is due to Castillo and Katz (1957).
I think the OP is asking the following: If an enzyme is not specific one substrate, but is simultaneously presented with a pair of substrates, which one 'wins' and how do we decide?

Note: The term equilibrium is different from steady-state w.r. t chemical reactions. Steady state is the right term for the above example.
No. But a strong correlation may nevertheless be an indicator for heritability (it makes it more likely). The reason is, that the correlation in the phenotype (birth weight) is not only due a correlation in the genotype but also a correlation in the environment of the child and its mother (culture, economical situation, genes, etc of their respective mothers).
$$P_\text{fix} \approx \frac{1-e^{-4Nsp} }{1-e^{-4Ns}} \qquad (1)$$ So, I was reading the original paper but the provided derivation doesn't appear clear to me.
, $\dot x_i/ x_i$) is the difference between the fitness of $i$ (i.e. , $\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}x_{j}$) and the average fitness $\phi$ of the whole population.
In general Analytic solutions only exist for special cases. Therefore a good way of approaching these problems is to first act like they don’t and be happy if you can see how to derive one.

Your first question seems to be terminological. (And hence, in this sense, is more "robust" than other rules. But this is just a definition, and anyone is free to modify it as they see fit for their own purposes, as long as they are clear and consistent in their use of terminology.
The hairdresser has bought scissors, shampoo, etc. He may even heat his/her store and supply it with electricity. These are all input to the production on which VAT was paid.
E.g. Therefore these are separate properties. You can argue you need both, but perhaps you are willing to part with one or the other.
First it is important to define our terms. When you ask, "does a disagreement regarding how to weight the voters entail a disagreement regarding aggregation rule?

I am trying to compile a list of winners of the Nobel memorial prize in economics whose thesis advisor also won the prize.

The following is a slight rewording of an example in Richard Thaler's Misbehaving (1): Positive framing of certain outcome Imagine you are $300 richer than you are today.
If the utility is continuous and locally insatiable then the Hicksian demand equals the Walrasian demand. So you'll need to look for a utility function which violates atleast one of these.
I believe your questions are: Q1. Definition 4. We interpret $\sim$ as the indifference relation. $x \sim y$ if $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim x$.
Here is another example with two consumers (A and B), two goods (X and Y): \begin{eqnarray*} u_A(x_A, y_A)  =  \min(x_A, y_A), \ \omega_A = (1, 0) \\ u_B(x_B, y_B)  =  \min(x_B, y_B), \ \omega_B = (0, 1) \end{eqnarray*} In this case, every feasible allocation $((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B))$ satisfying $y_A = x_A$ is a competitive equilibrium, and is supported by price vectors $(p_x, p_y) \in \mathbb{R}^2_+$ such that $p_xx_A +p_yy_A = p_x$ holds.

It may be helpful to consider a phenomenon from politics called the Condorcet paradox. This is a situation that can happen in votes, in which the overall population would vote for A over B, would vote for B over C, and would vote for C over A.
No, single-peakedness is not necessary for majority rule to be transitive. For example, "single-dipped" preference profiles (the vertical mirror image of "single-peaked" profiles) also produce transitive majority preferences.
The statement is not true. Let $x_A + x_B = 1$, $y_A + y_B = 1$. Let $U_A(x_A,y_A) = x_A + \ln(y_A)$, $U_B(x_B,y_B) = x_B + \ln(y_B + 1)$.

Yes, there are many. For each $a  0$, we have $(a+1, a) \succ (a, a)$, and therefore, $u(a+1, a)  u(a, a)$. Since $a \in \mathbb{R_{++}}$, there are uncountably many such intervals, but set of rational numbers are countable.

You just need to use the violation of transitivity and proceed by contradiction. (another two reals). Since the reals are transitive, we conclude $u(x_1,y_1)\geq u(x_3,y_3)$ which in turn implies that $(x_1,y_1)R(x_3,y_3)$.
Utility functions and indifference curves are the same object considered from different visual/conceptual angles. Below an illustration on $U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{0.
Car prices haven’t gone up due to the majority of auto makers profits being from the truck and SUV market. Trucks and SUVs have gone up 40% since 2007.
Show that there is no continuous utility function which represents the lexicographic preferences $\mathscr{L}$ given by $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$ if and only if $x_1  y_1$ or $x_1 = y_1$ and $x_2  y_2$.
Your example is (more or less): You can now try and argue what kind of preferences these are. If you are interested in consumer theory, you should find some proper course book or other materials - there's plenty of it on the Internet - just google it.

I would like to ask for your help. Infinitely many thanks for your help! Thus, I would have liked to see a proof of this statement and how is it possible to build such a utility representation.
There are two firs in the market. They produce perfect substitutes at cost $c(y_i)=y_i/3$ for i=1,2. However firm 1 has the opportunity to announce the output it will produce to firm 2 before the firms have produced any output.

Also the regressors should be strictly exogenous, but it's the same for linear FE models. , average partial effects) are not obtainable.
GDP: If I remember correctly, Congressional budget office offers 10-12 yr forward potential gdp every quarter, from which you can derive predicted potential growth.

I have a dataset with mean and median wages for particular geographic areas around the United States. I am interested in calculating the wage premium between some areas.
Are there DSGE models with agents with different skill levels (and according wage differences) who can develop or lose their skills and with employees with dynamic/changing skill levels and skill domains?
Quarterly GDP growth can be calculated either in terms of YoY change or - in the case of seasonally adjusted data - in terms of QoQ change.
The OECD might be quite specific in their terminology. I think the use of QoQ (quarter on quarter) and YoY (year on year) are more commonly used.

What's the difference between "industrial capitalism" and "agrarian capitalism" and "mercantilism" and the "industrial revolution" and the 20th century ideas of "Keynesianism"?
1" is false. World Resources Institute: This rate is roughly 2. 1 children per woman. 2. 1 is simply a very crude and made-up figure.
Both of these things can be thought of as Supply/Demand problems where the relevant concept is actually how Demand is decided.

NBA stars create more money (ticket prices, jersey sales, merchandising, branding). But all the doctors earn realitively well.
The economics and public policy website, Crooked Timber, devoted a question entirely to that subject recently. New Old Keynesianism delineates the differences between Old Old Keynesianism, Old New Keynesianism, New Old Keynesianism and New New Keynesianism such that "New" means “post Global Financial Crisis” and “Old” to refers to a belief that the economy can be in a long-run high unemployment equilibrium.
There are many ressources available online Synth is a statistical software that implements synthetic control methods for causal inference in comparative case studies with aggregate data as described in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010), and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2013).
Are their balances considered demand deposits, and therefore in M1? They seem a form of money, but not exactly. They can be used to buy products.

I have read many articles about Bayesian thinking. When math is involved, I find it very difficult to compute the posterior mentally.
I don't see that phrase in the linked PDF, but I don't think these terms are being used in a manner particularly special to economics, and this would probably be better suited to English Language SE.
Let say the electorate consists of three segments of voters: 1, 2, and 3 with corresponding weak preference relations defined over the candidates.

As far as i understand in the Krugman target zone model the following equation describes the behaviour of the exchange rate within and outside a target zone $s_t = f_t + \alpha E_t(ds_t/dt)$.
I think your questions are very interesting. We also avoid costs associated with accelerated climate change. Our options for helping those farmers or manufacturers out of work include but are not limited to: incentives to switch to crop farming start-up programs to encourage new land use such as afforestation or sanctuaries incentives for transport, retail, accommodation, or local government to provide training or apprenticeship schemes for those out of work.
Time series on rental price of capital can be estimated using $$r=\frac{P_k}{P}(i-inf+\delta)$$ here, $P_k$ is the price of capital goods (price index for capital goods), $P$ is a deflator, $i$ is nominal interest rate, $inf$ is an inflation rate and $\delta$ is depreciation rate of physical capital stock.
in preparation for our upcoming exam, our tutor has uploaded sample questions. One of them is the following: This is my solution: Which differs from the solution, which gives the ordinary square root of the same parameters, not the 4th-one.
As mentioned by Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green, the equality is true "for all $p$ and $w$". This implies the former equality and also explains why it is not only true for the upscaled new prices and income $(p,w)=(\kappa p_0,\kappa w_0)$ but actually for any prices and income because both $\kappa$ and $(p_0,w_0)$ can be arbitrary.

My textbook describes the GVA at Market Prices as: GVA at Basic Prices + Product Taxes - Product Subsidies. Various sources online refer this same sum (GVA at Basic Prices + Product Taxes - Product Subsidies) as the GDP at Market Prices.
Partly your question relates to more general questions like "buy versus rent a house", or "buy versus lease a machine".
I have learned about the Markov decision process (MDP) formalism in the context of machine learning. I know that micro theorists also study MDP's, and agent behaviour in this context (both single and multi-agent I think).

I would like your help to use the correct terminology to define a Bayes Correlated Equilibrium (BCE) and a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) in a "game" with one player.
Question 1: Is it correct to say that $S^*$ is at least as informative as $S^1$? Is it correct to say that: $\forall S \in \mathcal{S}$ where $S\equiv ((T_i)_{i=1}^N, \pi)$, there exists a combination $S^*\in \mathcal{S}$ of $\underline{S}$ and $S$ such that $S^*$ and $S$ are informationally equivalent.
26 of the linked paper). 6-9 this paper. Let me summarise the game as described in the paper. There are $N\in \mathbb{N}$ players, with $i$ denoting a generic player.
I think the reason you're having difficulty is that your definition is actually not equivalent to Bergemann and Morris' definition of BCE, except under specific assumptions which include the ones you state regarding independence.

Define a Bayesian game as follows: $$G = \left\langle I, \left(A_i,T_i,(p_{t_i})_{t_i \in T_i}, u_i \right)_{i \in I} \right\rangle$$ $I$ is the set of players $A_i$ is the action set for player $i$, $T_i$ is the set of possible types for player $i$, $p_{t_i} \in \Delta(T_{-i})$ is player $i$'s beliefs regarding the types of the other players.

And on p. " Also, I'm somewhat unsurprised that Stiglitz turns out to be an editor of this journal. 23 What remains unclear is whether the Eurozone authorities are willing and legally entitled to impose EU-related rather than Eurozone-specific hardships on an exiting country.
Unsustainable is a strong word for describing state budgets. For all NJ short comings, they have a massive tax base that actually pays taxes, a responsible and effective legal system, the US FED, non-corrupt politicians (but not effective), New York City, and industry.

europa. By the way, by my research, in 2017 the Japanese debt-to-GDP was more like 253%. So stay tuned friend as evidence is accumulating that developed economies such as Japan and in particular, the United States, are on dangerous ground and possibly past the point of no return.
The EU has a harmonized CPI methodology (HICP). ] Methods used for combining prices to give elementary aggregates vary widely among the individual countries of the G-20, the geometric mean (Jevons index) is the method most commonly used (10 countries plus France, Italy and the United Kingdom).

Several points need to be considered. Indeed, different sectors display significantly different productivity and efficiency of the labor factor.

In recent coverage of the Fed's repo operation, I was struck by this line: It also indicated Wall Street is struggling to absorb record sales of Treasury debt to fund a swelling U.S.
This question already has an accepted answer, which addresses the economic drawbacks of rent control quite well. I did want to contribute one additional aspect that hasn't really been addressed: Rent control can be viewed as a form of (limited) compensation to residents/tenants, for their contribution to making their neighborhoods desirable places to live (and thus driving up property values.
Given that: MV=PY Or P = (M)(V) / Y Where M is the money supply, V velocity of money, P price level and Y real GDP Considering that the current rate of M2 is increasing at 7% per year over the last 12 months, and real GDP is now forecasted to decelerate from 1.

It seems that Warnock-Smith is basing his remark on the official Airports Commission forecasts (made in 2014). 38-48), so I'm not going to reproduce them here.
I think it will help to fill in some of the missing causal elements in this picture. Therefore this is a sign that the economy will not do well in the future.
Both answers here are giving really good definitions of the concepts, but I think it's important to additionally talk about the relation between the two to clarify the justified confusion and to compare them.

Your questions can be answered when you think in terms of this equilibrium. Suppose your income increases from \$100 a week to \$200 a week.
Which brings us to the first point of confusion... This is not a contradiction as much as a competing factor. I believe that an increase in the demand for real capital means the same thing as the increase in the demand for loanable funds The reduced demand for money increases the supply of loanable funds, which induces more demand, which is then used to purchase real capital.
I learned from the Fischer Effect that Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Rate . I'm aware that this is the short-run affect.
As a conclusion , if IR decrease in the future, it will make people expect higher return on long term bonds today , since there is more risk.
So I'm reading mankiw"s principles of economics and I'm in the chapter about the influence of monetary and fiscal policy on Aggregate demamd.

It seems that you have firm-level panel data over multiple industries in multiple countries. Year fixed effects control for trends.
Wikipedia says: 'Fermi's golden rule describes a system which begins in an eigenstate, ${\displaystyle |i\rangle } |i\rangle$ , of an unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H_0$ and considers the effect of a perturbing Hamiltonian, $H'$ applied to the system.
If you used these to derive your IOT, then you can use those to build your SAM, though note you need both the Supply AND Use tables for this.
The surviving probability at period 2 is p. The interest rate is fixed at r. Under what condition she prefers the economy with the PAYG pension?
In Notes on the Theory of Choice (assuming this is what you refer to by "Kreps (1988)"), Kreps does not appear to mention WARP as such.

My Lagrangian is: $L=\sum\limits_{t=0}^T \beta^tU(f(k_t)-k_{t+1})+\sum\limits_{t=0}^T\lambda_t(f(k_t)-k_{t+1}). $ My FOC for $[k_{t+1}]$ is: $\beta^tU'(f(k_t)-k_{t_1}^*)(-1)-\lambda_t^*+\beta^{t+1}U'(f(k_{t+1}^*-k_{t+2})+\lambda^*_{t+1}f'(k_{t+1})^*=0$.
Real life is more complicated than that. For example Companies A and B might be competing in the same market sector, but then collaborate on producing a new product aimed at a particular niche in the market.
This would mainly be observed as "endowments", such as in intergenerational macro models which use (e.g. ) 1 or more representative households in relation to resources initially available to individuals, who then face various constraints (generally modelled as a differential market interest rate for borrowers and savers).
The definition of revealed preferred seems like coming out of nowhere. Why there's a string of direct revealed preferences lie between?

So, for example, when you have performed a t-test, you have assumed that a mean exists and that it is meaningful. Non-parametric methods allow you to perform tests on data without reference to a parameter.
In The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, Gary Becker said: The combined assumptions of maximizing behavior, market equilibrium, and stable preferences, used relentlessly and unflinchingly, form the heart of the economic approach as I see it.
Problem: According to Wulf Gaertner’s (2009, p. ” This makes sense, however, when I looked up the definition of a `strictly increasing function/transformation’ I became confused regarding how this would allow one to represent cases of indifference as well as cases of strict preference.
The first has to do with what happens in reality, and it implies that the marginal relation is constant. The second may be obtained even if the actual relation is not linear, but non-linear in specific ways that permit to obtain it by a suitable transformation of the data.

Find the returns to scale for he following production function- $(x_1 + 1)^. The answer given, however, is decreasing returns to scale.
My notes says that if $u(. )$ is strictly quasiconcave and differentiable, by the supporting hyperplane theorem, there exists $p 0$ and $w \geq 0$ such that $ x = x(p,w)$ $\forall x$.
So the second part of your question is true. Hope this clarifies. It is at the tangent point where MRS equals the slope of the budget line.

Then maximize with respect to $x_1$. This is a problem that has also an inequality constraint, alongside the budget constraint that is here given as an equality.
for this problem you must conciser two possible utility functions: $$u(\text{x})=x_1+x_3\ \ \text{if} \ \ x_1x_2$$ $$u(\text{x})=x_2+x_3\ \ \text{if} \ \ x_1x_2$$ The demands of these then proceed how you would for any case of perfect substitutes.

No, it was moved to chat because Stack Exchange is getting tired of this nonsense and asked me to "please avoid extended discussions in comments".
It will vary in value because trust in it will fluctuate just as trust in facebook fluctuates. There will also be volatility as trust varies in confidence in the payment system; its integrity and security; how exchangeable it is; its exposure to fraud, to tax, to money-laundering investigations For holders, there is also significant counter-party risk in whether Facebook chooses to honour their holding.

But in reality, consumption is often done not by an individual but by an household/family. All household members live in the same house, use the same furniture and the same electricity equipment, etc.
There is another counter for sugar, where I can buy one unit of sugar for a price of $p_2$. My preferences are such that I always want 1 unit of sugar with 1 unit of coffee; if I consume units of coffee and sugar in the ratio $1:1$, additional units of only one of the two don't give me extra utility.

we need a minimum of 2 sugars initally so we can say $x=2$ for 1 lemon so $y=1$ Plugging those values into our budget constraint: $44=20x+y$ $44=20(2)+(1)$ $4441$ Notice how we end up having 3 left over, however with the budget constraint and preferences provided our consumption bundle will be 2 sugars and 1 lemon.
What is a good reference on this problem? I thought of several options: Calculate an aggregate utility function, e. g: $$ u_F(x,y) = \min_{i\in F} u_i(x,y) $$ Then, calculate the demand in the usual way: select a bundle $(x_F,y_F)$ that maximizes the aggregate utility $u_F$ in the budget-set.
Consider an exchange economy with two goods, e.g. home furniture (x) and electrical equipment (y). There are two families.

I think any (and none) of your answers is correct. More generally speaking, if purchase decisions are made via some game, then you have to solve the game first in order to obtain the demand functions.

Let $c = 0$ and $Q_k = \sum_{i = 1}^k{q_i}$. For $j = n$ the best response is given by \begin{align} b_n(Q_{n-1}) = \arg\max_{q_n}(1 - Q_{n-1} - q_n)q_n = \frac{1- Q_{n-1}}{2}.
Note first that for each nontrivial (more than one point) compact interval $I$, there exists a strictly increasing function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $I$.
I was carefully rereading the underlying paper (Bloch, 1996) and found what I was looking for. Let $N = \{1,\ldots,n\}$ denote the set of agents and let $\Pi_{\{1, \ldots, i-1\}}$ denote the set of coalition structures of $\{1, \ldots, i-1\}$ for all $i \in \{2,\ldots,n\}$.

Hello. I'm graduate student in Japan. This time, what I want to ask is how to solve the profit maximization problem using the image production function and derive the demand function.
I would construct and maintain only the full (unbalanced) data set with many variables with many missing values. Why? We can always extract balanced panel data sets from the full one; we can't go the other way around.

What I'm reading seems to suggest that the price of the subsidiary's stock will converge to that of its parent, but I'm not sure why.
If you multiply out any one of the equations, $$w_{clothes}= \beta _ {clothes} + \alpha_{clothes} \cdot \ kids + (\gamma _{0.
I have the following demand equation system (expenditure ratio model): $w_{clothes}= \beta _ {clothes} + \alpha_{clothes} * \ kids + (\gamma _{0.
I can provide you with a sketch of proof to proceed. The quantity $\sqrt{n}(\bar{x}-\mathrm{E}(X)) \overset{d}{\to} N(0,\,\mathrm{V}(X))$ by Central Limit Theorem.
I am trying to solve a rate of return question from the book Engineering Economics by R. Paneerselvam. following are the factors: i) Initial cost ii) Annual incremental revenue iii) Life iv) Life-end Salvage value (Rs.

If such subsidiaries bypass the restrictions, what is the remaining purpose of FTAs? Or something else? One of the ways corporations trade transnationally in the face of local restrictions on market access is to set up subsidiary companies or regional offices from which trade is conducted.
I cannot comment on the benefits/limitations of this though. Moreover, these accounts were necessary as we had to deal with transactions involving various currencies.
Is the real wage counter or pro- cyclical? I've read in some textbooks that the real wage is mildly pro-cyclical, but I've also found some papers stating that it's acyclical.

Have you tried writing down your intuition? Maybe the preference relationship of the electorate as a whole is transitive, but not complete, or complete but not transitive, etc.

Though behavioural economics has been popularized over the past decade in both industry and pop culture, it seems that not much has changed with regard to the standard economic definition of rationality.
Here's another way, using the same notation as Adam, to get to the same result: $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = P(\text{searching twice | being matched})\cdot P(\text{another match | searching twice}) $$ Now, $$P(\text{searching twice | being matched}) = \frac{P(\text{searching twice and being matched})}{P(\text{being matched})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s} $$ $$P(\text{another match | searching twice}) = \frac{P(\text{another match and searching twice})}{P(\text{searching twice})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} $$ So, $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s}\frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} = \frac{2\psi_u\nu}{(1+\psi_u)}$$
The proposition is from lecture notes of advanced econometrics of Yongmiao Hong: A1: $\{Y_t,X_t'\}_{t=1}^n$ is an i.i.d.
Suppose that a binary relation satisfies only: Independence axiom: $L≿L′⟺α\circ L+(1−α)\circ L′′≿α\circ L′+(1−α) \circ L′′$ Reduction to simple lotteries: For all $g$, $g~g'$, $g'$ is the simple lotteries associated with g.
Short answer Perhaps your concern about stimulating demand is explained by the broken window fallacy. We do not need robots to stimulate demand of rival goods.

Intuition Well, when $r$ is zero, you are just getting value $A$ per time unit, so total present value will be $A \cdot t$.
The first / second seller terminology can be confusing here (does it relate to time or to conditionality?). It's safer to focus on a particular seller.

EDITED with insights from the comment below. Does $\mathcal{Q}^*\subseteq \mathcal{B}$ too? " condition defining $ \mathcal{Q}^*$ is satisfied.
Let $P_{V}\in \Delta(\mathcal{V})$ be the probability distribution of $V$. Nature draws a realisation, $v$, of $V$ from $P_{V}$.

You have specialized the definition of BCE in two dimensions: there is only one player, and the player has no private information.
Consider the following static single-agent choice problem under uncertainty. Let $V$ be the state of the world with support $\mathcal{V}$ and probability distribution $P_V\in \Delta(\mathcal{V})$.
A one-player BCE of the game described is a probability distribution $P_{Y,V}\in \Delta(\mathcal{Y}\times \mathcal{V})$ such that: 1) $\forall v \in \mathcal{V}$ $$\sum_{y\in \mathcal{Y}}P_{Y,V}(y,v)=P_V(v)$$ 2) $\forall y\in \mathcal{Y}$ and $\forall \tilde{y}\neq y$ $$ \sum_{v\in \mathcal{V}} [u(y,v)-u(\tilde{y},v)] \times P_{Y,V}(y,v)\geq 0 $$ Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the set of BCE.
The state of the world has support $\mathcal{V}$. The DM receives the payoff $u(y,v)$ depending on the chosen action $y$ the realisation $v$ of $V$.
$P_V$ is the 3-variate standard normal distribution. A one-player BCE of the game described is a probability distribution $P_{Y,V}\in \Delta(\mathcal{Y}\times \mathcal{V})$ such that: 1) $\forall v \in \mathcal{V}$ $$\sum_{y\in \mathcal{Y}}P_{Y,V}(y,v)=P_V(v)$$ 2) $\forall y\in \mathcal{Y}$ and $\forall \tilde{y}\neq y$ $$ \sum_{v\in \mathcal{V}} (v_y-v_{\tilde{y}}) \times P_{Y,V}(y,v)\geq 0 $$ Question: 1) Is it obvious that a BCE exists and is unique in my example?

From the first order condition for optimality, we know that (equation (4) in the paper): $$U_x(x,Z(r)-x,S(r))x'(r) - U_y(x,Z(r)-x,S(r))x'(r) + U_s(x,Z(r)-x,S(r))S'(r)=0.

This BVAR combines a Minnesota-type prior (see Litterman, 1984) with priors that take into account the degree of persistence and cointegration in the variables.
In the case of Apple at least, the answer is yes: this article dated August 31 2019 talks about the impact of the latest round of tariffs on Apple products produced in China.
Through a quick research I have found that VEC, VAR, SVAR models are the most common. Are they though good forecasters?

We also commonly use measures like means squared error, mean absolute percentage error, Theil's U, etc. etc. You then compare your forecast predictions to known data and to those of other forecasts.
DSGE models and BVARs are commonly used in academia and policy circles. They generate different performances (e.g. , in forecasting) and perhaps serve different purposes.
I want to know the impact of misspecifying lag levels in AR models. What will be the impact of estimating AR(P-1) on the estimated coefficients of $\phi_1 - \phi_{p-1}$, can they be consistently estimated.
I'm aware of Blanchard, Olivier, and Jordi Gali. 2007. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Oil Shocks: Why Are the 2000s So Different from 1970s.
It seems to be a young field, but is there any consensus on strength and weaknesses of this new shock? Is it the answer to some puzzles such as the risk premium puzzle?

$\newcommand{\vect}[1]{{\bf #1}}$ Note that you can write the system in the form $$ \dot{\vect{x}} = A \vect{x} + \vect{b} $$ where $$ \vect{x} = \left(\begin{array}{c} x \\ y\end{array}\right), ~~~~ A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1  1 \\ 2  -1\end{array}\right), ~~~~~ \vect{b} = \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 5\end{array}\right) $$ A fixed point $\vect{x}^*$ is a point for which $A\vect{x}^* + \vect{b} = 0$, which in this case is $$ \vect{x}^* = \left(\begin{array}{c} -2 \\ 1\end{array}\right) $$ Now define the variable $$ \vect{z} = \vect{x} - \vect{x}^* $$ and note that $$ \dot{\vect{z}} = \dot{\vect{x}} = A\vect{x} + \vect{b} = A\vect{x} - A\vect{x}^* = A(\vect{x} - \vect{x}^*) = A\vect{z} $$ That is, $$ \dot{\vect{z}} = A \vect{z} $$ What you need to do now is to find the eigen-decomposition of $A$
I have a question about a derivation in Abraham (1987)'s simple job market matching model (equations 3 through 7): She begins by writing down tautologies: J - V = L - U = E where J is the number of jobs, V is the number of vacancies, L is the total labor force, U is the total unemployed, and E is the total employed.
Note that function $p$ actually depends upon a single variable $u/v$ and I prefer avoiding the abuse of notation (source of confusion) and write $p(u/v) = P(u,v)$.
$ \textbf{Answer:} $ Simply put, it does not matter which good goes on which axis as long as the relationship between the two goods is adjusted for correctly.

If X and Y are normal, then the distribution of X conditional on Y is: $$ X | (Y = y) = N(\mu_x + \rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}(y - \mu_y), (1-\rho)^2 \sigma^2_x )$$ Therefore, $E[X|Y = y] = \mu_x + \rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}(y - \mu_y) = (\mu_x - \mu_y (\rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y})) + (\rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y})y $ which is linear in $y$.
Why is this the case? Since Vacancy rate is defined as following, let $A,Q,U$ denote number of vacancies in the economy, labor force, unemployed respectively.
I do not have any economics background, but currently I have some data sets regarding price index. Sorry if the question is confusing.
Is it that the consumer would not consume anything of the nonlinear good in case of insufficient wealth? No, it is exactly the other way around.
The utility function of the consumer is $5x^{0. 5}y^-{0. 5x^{0. 5}}{1000} = \frac{2. 5}y^{0. 5x^{-0. 5}$ Substituting them into (1) gives: $\frac{2.

If OA is a part of FA. The second equation follows from the first: $CA + KA = FA \wedge OA \neq 0 \Rightarrow FA - OA = CA +KA -OA \neq CA +KA$.
The basic principle of BOP accounting is double entry bookkeeping. In short, every transaction enters twice. As a consequence of this, by definition $$\text{Current account } (CA) + \text{Capital account } (KA) = \text{Financial account } (FA)$$ Note that this may differ depending on how you classify BOP accounts.
Let me rephrase the question in my own words: in an environment where automation increasingly is taking over, are there alternatives besides leaving the have-nots behind or providing a basic income?
I can safely assume that the market is efficient in the sense that two-week-old prices don't help to predict the price of the current week.
The negation would be "there does not exist at least one person that is better off, or, there exists someone that is worse off.

The Balance of Payments (BOP) records, in summary form, every single international transaction. * Also, the BOP uses a double-entry accounting system, where every entry MUST be balanced (hence the name) by an entry (or entries) that is (or are together) equal and opposite.
Without additional information, it is hard to answer your question but I would say that a moderation model is like any econometric model (and in fact, it is an econometric model).
According to the IMF's BPM6, which should be taken as the "most" standard, it is impossible for the BOP to be out of balance.

The problem starts at time t0. Rewards decrease after each time step, at the same rate, and Rw > Rl always. For example at t0 Rw = 100, Rl = 50, p = 0.
It simply depends on the shape of the marginal external damages. If the total damages are linear in output, then the marginal damages are constant, and the gradient of the marginal social cost is the same as that of the marginal private cost.
I agree with Dan it is likely a typo. Some definitions (using your notations) Investment : $f_0$ Investment one year later : $f_1$ Net income : $f_1 - f_0$ ROI: $-1 + \frac{f_1}{f_0}$ It follows that the correct code should be ROI = (goog/goog.

I'm an engineer with minimal to zero knowledge about economical topics, please be patient with me if the following question makes no sense or is too basic ...
One opinion voiced (in The Economist) around the 2008 recession was that: Decoupling does not mean that an American recession will have no impact on developing countries.
A game where the payoff function $F_1,F_2$ are such that for any two strategy profiles $s,s'$ $$ F_1(s)  F_1(s') \Leftrightarrow F_2(s)  F_2(s') $$ is called an antagonistic game.

I've been reading up on the von-Neumann and Savage proofs for the existence of an expected utility representation. Clearly this violates Allais' paradox.

A trembling hand perfect (THP) equilibrium may not survive iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies, as is shown by the following example.
For what values $x$, $y$ the profile $(D,L)$ is Pareto optimal? \begin{array}{c|ccc}  L  R \\ \hline U  x,5  x+2,y \\ D 1,-1  x,0 \\ \end{array} Is correct $x1$ ?
Consider the following problem \begin{align} \max_u F(x,u)\\ \text{s.t. } u \in [0,\bar u]. \end{align} Any idea how to merge the two constraints $u \geq 0$ and $\bar u - u \geq 0$ into one constraint $f(u,\bar u) \geq 0$?
Consider the game below. $$ \begin{array}{|r|c|c|} \hline LR\\\hline U5,14,0\\\hline M6,03,1\\\hline D6,44,4\\\hline \end{array} $$ Both $U$ and $M$ are weakly dominated by $D$.

Pick any set of non-negative $p_1,\dots,p_n$ such that $p_1+\cdots+p_n=1$. The convex combination of degenerate lotteries $L^1,\dots,L^n$ with the $p_i$'s can be written as \begin{align} p_1L^1+\cdots+p_nL^n=p_1(1,0,\dots,0)+\cdots+p_n(0,\dots,0,1)\\ =\bigl(p_1(1)+p_2(0)+\cdots+p_n(0),\;\dots,\;p_1(0)+\cdots+p_{n-1}(0)+p_n(1)\bigr)\\ =(p_1,\dots,p_n).

] The figures revealed that Denmark’s richest 10 percent now own as much as 70 percent of the rest of the population put together – a clear indication the government didn’t need to consider any more reforms aimed at benefiting the wealthiest Danes.
808 was the third-highest in the world. As of the year 2000, Denmark's income Gini coefficient of 0. (After-transfer) income inequality and wealth inequality are obviously not the same thing, but I would intuitively expect that, all else equal, they would be reasonably well correlated across countries.

I believe the following is the multiplicative property of bilinearity: $$ Y=F(K,AL) $$ $$ c_1 F(K,AL) = F(c_1 K, AL) $$ $$ c_2 F(K,AL) = F(K, c_2 AL) $$ But when we have multiplied through the production function with a constant we have done so through each term as below $$ c_3 F(K,AL) = F(c_3 K, c_3 AL) $$ e.g.

A rich person can own companies, shares, houses used for renting etc. that are worth billions of $US. And then he/she can have only his own wage as a leisure wealth.
The Gini coefficient is defined as the normalized Gini index. If $G$ is the Gini index, $0 \leq G \leq \frac{n-1}{n}$. The Gini coefficient $G^* = \frac{n}{n-1} G$ is a normalization such that $0\leq G^* \leq 1$.

Both distributions are often modelled log-normal, with a substantial number of zeros. A pareto distribution is also sometimes used (Piketty  Saez (2012), p.

: $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1INT_i*AVG\_Overall_i + \beta_2AVG\_A_i + \beta_3AVG\_B_i + \beta_4INT_i + \beta_5AVG\_Overall_i + u_i \tag{2}$$ However, AVG_Overall is by definition collinear with both AVG_A and AVG_B, making it difficult to distinguish the different effects of AVG_A and AVG_B ($\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$).

$AVCAR$ means, without considering fixed cost, the firm is making a profit of $AR-AVC0$ per unit of output. Compare the two options: keep producing vs shutdown: Keep producing: $\text{Avg Profit}=\underbrace{AR-AVC}_{0}-AFC$ Shutdown: $\text{Avg Profit}=0-AFC$ Since $AVCAR$, staying in production is better since the revenues can be used to offset part of the fixed costs already incurred.

Well, I got basically a question about economics of our world, I hope I'm wrong in my assumptions, because it's pretty ugly and I'm really hope it's more about me being wrong than it's actually the truth.
over the period. However, I've seen it done taking savings rate and such values for the last year of the period. So, it turns out something lie: Avg Growth 2010-2012 = GDP 2010 + Sav Rate 2012 + Hum K 2012 etc...
I believe the money pump works like this: At $T=0$ borrow a hundred dollars from Henry the hyperbolic discounter for the full time period $t$.
ASSET PRICING THEORY: Cochrane, Asset Pricing is a good book in that it displays the way that hard-core asset pricers see the world.
I've come across this little parable purporting to show why exponential discounting is superior to hyperbolic discounting1: The greater bowing [of the hyperbolic discount curve] means that if a hyperbolic discounter engaged in trade with someone who used an exponential curve, she'd soon be relieved of her money.

Please do correct me if I am wrong). Thanks for any help :) (For if there is full-comparability between all individuals’ absolute-scale-measured utility functions, then their rank orders of alternatives are comparable, so surely a functional such as maximin can be used.
Thanks for any help! Weak Pareto$’$: $\forall x, y \in X$, $\forall i \in N$: $( \ u_i(x) \  \ u_i(y) \ ) \ \Longrightarrow \ (xPy)$.
I don't think the edgeworth box will help here since there is only 1 good in the economy that is exchangeable. According to 1's utility function, he would always want to allocate his entire endowment of time to leisure.
In social choice theory, Arrow's impossibility theorem, the general possibility theorem or Arrow's paradox is an impossibility theorem stating that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) So, I'm looking for an example where the preferences satisfy unrestricted domain, non dictatorship, IIA and is an ordering, but not meet the Pareto criteria.

There are at least two other examples of SWFs that satisfy these conditions. You could also look at Chapter 2 of the book Axioms of Cooperative Decision-Making, by Hervé Moulin (1988).
Note that an alternative being highest-ranked by an agent involves comparisons with all other alternatives, which raises doubts that your method satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives.
A. Barnett, H. Moulin, M. Salles,  N. J. Schofield (Eds. ), Social choice,welfare,and ethics (pp. 163–185). In W. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
Let the set of alternatives be $A = \left\{a_1,a_2,... ,a_k\right\}$. Let the number of players be $n$. Let the set of preference orderings over $A$ be $\mathcal{P}$.
My favorite example is the initial formulation of Arrow's impossibility theorem in the first edition of Arrows' "Social Choice and Individual Values" (1951).

This question comes out of Hansen's Econometrics ((https://www. ssc. wisc. edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics. pdf)) In section 2.
Let $\Vert A \Vert$ denote the spectral norm of a random matrix. Let $x$ and $u_k$ be N$\times$T matrices. Denote $\beta \cdot u = \sum_{k=1}^K\beta_ku_k $, where $\beta$ is a K-vector and $\beta_k$ a scalar.
If the function $ f(x,y) = (x-\alpha)^\beta \cdot y^{1-\beta} $ is homogeneous of degree $ k $, then it must be true that $ f(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^k \cdot f(x,y) $ for $ \lambda \in \mathbb{R} $ and some constant $ k $.
The asymptotic sampling distribution, after taking plim, of the OLS estimator is given by $\sqrt{N}(\hat{\beta}-\beta) = E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} \left(1/\sqrt{N} \sum_{I=1}^NX_ie_i \right) $ It must be shown that the asymptotic variance can be written as: $ Var[E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} 1/\sqrt{N} \sum_{I=1}^NX_ie_i] = \left( E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} \right) \left( E[X_iX_i^T e_i^2]\right) \left( E[X_i X_i^T]^{-1} \right) $ Because the variance is linear in parameters, my idea was to start like this: $V[\sqrt{N}(\hat{\beta}-\beta)] = \sqrt{N}Var[\hat{\beta}] + 0$ Because the $Var[\beta]=0$.
Edit: My previous answer contained a mistake for the case where $x$ is restricted to $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$. Moreover, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds strictly unless $y - \delta$ is a multiple of $p$.

Using your school's logo is probably copyright infringement, assuming the logo's copyright has not expired (i.e. , its author has been dead for for over 70 years or it was a work-for-hire work published over 95 years ago) and assuming the logo contains sufficient creative expression to qualify for copyright at all.

Can books used as in public domain after expiration of copyright? Unfortunately there is no set procedure for that. Copyright doesn't require any registration.
Moreover, it would likely also be trademark infringement (a right which will not be expired, as long as it is still in active use), since that school's logo is probably used in a trademark capacity to indicate the source of a good or service.

, do you still live in this county, are you a U.S. Why Might A Prosecutor Fail To Object? So, if the prosecutor was really appalled by the dismissal for cause of so many women and felt that this would impair the prosecution's chance of obtaining a conviction materially, the prosecutor would have to dismiss the criminal charges so as to vacate the trial, before evidence was presented to the jury, and then refile the charges (assuming that this would be possible consistent with statutes of limitation and speedy trial requirements).
Conversely, the guilty plea and plea bargaining were until recently unknown to French law, and now it only applies to crimes for which the prosecution seeks a sentence not exceeding one year imprisonment.
How can this be possible? It also doesn't help that the rules governing judicial review of statutes and other governmental actions for their legality and constitutionality are rarely bright-line rules.

Who Is On The Risk? If the insured had losses beyond what was covered by the insurance payment, or losses different in kind from what was covered by the insurance payment, and the insured recovered damages from the party at fault for those losses, this additional recovery would not be subject to the subrogation lien.
Talk to the Board. I'm so smart! They are to inform you of your rights and guide you on the appropriate action, forms and procedure to assist you in resolving any issues you have.
A tenant can only be held liable for any damage that is caused during the course of the tenancy if not pre-existing (marked by notation in your lease, or photos upon move-in).
I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of July. You'll notice that I made it $875 this month. This is because we have not yet moved the cats into the apartment and don't think they'll be coming within the next month or so.
Why? In some states, this can be months. In your case, you vacated the property. Why? Landlords take on HUGE responsibilities for which there seems to be little respect for.

The NEC MDSVSensor3 is the same colorimeter as the X1 i1 Display Pro. But at this point it wouldn't hurt to try using DisplayCAL (formerly known as dispcalGUI) that is open source and lists the X1 i1 Display Pro as compatible.
I am looking for hardware for calibration of canvas prints. There are many solutions for monitors (as Datacolor Spyder, X-Rite i1 Display Pro, X-Rite ColorMunki) and paper printers (as Datacolor SpyderPRINT), but what hardware is needed to take color profiles for canvas printers?
I had also the same problem and tried following sensors: Spyder 4: spectraview profiler detectet also for calibration the Spyder 4 and did the job with an inconsistent result and with a high difference of Delta values.
Choices for backlight are: Unknown, Fluorescent (CCFL), White LED, and RGD LED. Which of these should I select to match my built in screen?
My in-warranty Dell U2412M monitor is wide gamut, and I've set it for Adobe RGB. Yet when I calibrate the monitor with a Spyder 4 by DataColor, I can only get 79% of the RGB color gamut.

I'm using a BenQ BL2711U and calibrating it with a Spyder 4 Elite. My numbers are: sRGB: 100% Adobe RGB: 81% NTSC: 78% When calibrating, I initially chose the "wide gamut" option, but during the calibration, the app said that my monitor was not wide gamut.
However, the standard brightness of the iMac screen is very bright, do I need to turn the brightness down before calibrating?
I purchased an ASUS PA329Q monitor to replace an NEC LCD2490WUXi2. I set up both monitors side-by-side and calibrated them to the same parameters (sRGB, D65, 150nit, gamma 2.

The notch in the bayonet tab in your 4th and 5th pictures are a dead giveaway for being a Minolta SR/MC/MD mount. The lack of a shutter-preferred autoexposure lug means it is not an MD lens.

This is a Minolta MD lens mount. It's hard to see in your photo, but by increasing the brightness, you can see the shutter-preferred auto-exposure lug (called the MD lug) (blue arrow), and the meter coupling (MC) tab (red arrow).
This appears to be the Minolta MC/MD mount. The giveaway is the aperture actuation lug inside the bayonet mount, and the notch in one of the bayonet tabs opposite the aperture lug, at the upper-left position of the bayonet ring in your 2nd photo.
Whether a metal can rust depends on the metal. Not really. Brass? This zinc layer is usually a little bit more hard-wearing than paint would be but usually makes it non-smooth.
Hang them. Use some wood sticks tied with some cotton treads hardened with glue. Use a metal hanger unwrapped. Use a PVC rig and hang the watches using "invisible" nylon thread hooked with unwrapped paper clips.
Even if the "MC" stand for "multi-Coated" and was printed on the lens for all of the various mounts for which it was made, the "MC" led me to compare it to the Minolta mount.

There are a few sling-style straps on the market today which are popular. The most common of these are the Black Rapid R-straps.
I believe you purchased the wrong item. The Nikon D300s is compatible with a laundry list of remotes which includes: MC-22 MC-30 MC-36 MC-21 MC-23 MC-25 MC-35 ML-3 Unfortunately the MC-DC2 is compatible with only the following camera bodies: D90 D7000 D5000 D3100 Source: NikonUSA

If you have the photos on you android you can use the android app https://github. com/k3b/APhotoManager/ that i implemented.
So after a little digging and with the help of Murat's hint I found the following field in some pictures. This basically is the way that Adobe Lightroom stores the information and it could be used as a defacto standard in your project.
exiftool can be used to create a gpx file, as Unapiedra describes. In some Linux distributions, the gpx. fmt does not need to be created because it is already installed.

See the ios app trevi. It has a nice timeline view, maps view and places view. Does windows have any app that can do something like that?

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.
Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?
I'm probably waaaaay too late in answering to help you out with your decision (which I'm sure you've made already) but maybe my answer will help others who have a similar question.

Flickr is dying in the Yogi Berra sense: "Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded. " That is, it's lost some of its social media impact because it has become so dilute.
How many other similar services can you name? they're really few. So, no, I don't think that flickr is dying, considering that they're relatively unique in this business.
If a falling camera gives you the chance, put your foot under it. Doh!). Ah - it wasn't around my neck! (Two cameras around neck, swapping cameras for different shot of dancers.
The moon is bathed in full sunshine, so the Sunny 16 rule should give you a good starting point. That will get you close.
I have a Canon PowerShot A3100IS digital camera. I was taking pictures but turned it off with the lens still open. I turned it back on, it loaded then made a beeping sound then a black screen came on with white letters stating: Lens error, will shut down automatically, restart camera and it turned off.

I’ve seldom got them immersed past the first section but that’s about 18” which is more than my wellies, so not a problem.
Sawgrass Gel Sublimation Inks (SubliJet-R) have been created in cartridges that fit the specific Ricoh printers. The ink lines would not work if the OEM inks were fed into the printer, so what your ad means is that no ink is in the lines and the printers are therefore "Sublimation Ready".
I've been looking around at various printers to use on-site for photo printing and one of the printers I came across was the Ricoh 3110DN and while I'm normally pretty good with this stuff, something confused me about the specs as on a couple of sites it is listed as being "sublimation ready" but then goes on to discuss the gel ink system it has.
Maybe, Ricoh Theta S matches your requirement. It has all the features you asked for which includes - HD recording (up to 25 mins), 30fps, Wi-Fi capability.

In the posts above the mention of "Sublimation Ready" in the context of Ricoh printers using Sawgrass Gel Sublimation Inks (SubliJet-R) is about heat transfer imprinting and not to be confused with "dye sublimation" printers like some older Olympus or Sony "photo" printers where the printers were used typically during "event photography" ...
I am aware that Panasonic Lumix GX9 is not weather sealed. I would like to use it as travel camera, which means all possible weather factors, also sometimes thrown without cover in backpack hiking trought the moutains...
There are lens filter wrenches available, such as these, but I find a rubber band works just as well, and always carry a few in my gadget bag.
The GH4 still trumps the GX8 for serious video work - you've noted the lack of headphone socket on the GX8 which is definitely important, but the DPReview preview notes a couple of potentially even bigger differences: Unlike the video-focused GH4, the GX8 doesn't offer 10-bit HDMI output and can't output video over HDMI at all while recording.
I wonder what is the purpose of the metal grid structure outside of the lens, for example, in the Fuji GX617. When you put a set of human hands in the same frame with a GX617, it becomes more apparent just how large the GX617 is.

Since the unit conversion says that W = J / s, so Ws = (J / s) * s = J, thus the unit J could just as well have been used.
A beauty dish gives a softer light than an unmodified flash, but not as soft as a softbox or shoot-through umbrella. This means that you can control the light more than when using a softbox.
Since the walls and ceiling are not cooperating, you'll have to actually move the SB700 off the camera. You can get a TTL cable for about $20.
My Canon 50D says the PC Sync port is good for 250V, any polarity. Sounds like it is driven by a bidirectional thyristor, triac or some such thing which has a recovery threshold.
Voila! Softened flash, no more Coccoon shots. You can use the translucent ones as diffusers for pop-up flashes. Take the lid off, cut a notch out of one side, place it on the flash and put the lid back on.

How reasonable is this assumption? Do flashes wear out? I'm under impression that a flash (both a built-in unit and an external speedlight) uses some kind of very high power lamp which may have limited durability.
When you trigger the shutter, the switch would close, 300V would flow and it would flash. If it was off, then there is no need to worry.
For high speed work I would look into the Paul C Buff Einstein. There's a pretty thorough write-up here: http://www. robgalbraith.
It's quite expensive. Here is a video demonstrating the light's HSS capability. Rotolight Anova Pro is a battery powered LED light that can actually double as a flash with High Speed Sync (HSS).

The polar radiation pattern of Fig. 5 204 1 80 1. We get: dΩ = dS cos(θ) / (z² + r²) dΦ = I(θ) dΩ = I(0) dS cos²(θ) / (z² + r²) E(r) = dΦ / dS = I(0) cos²(θ) / (z² + r²) but since cos(θ) = z / √(z² + r²), and I(0) = E(0) z², E(r) = E(0) cos⁴(θ) = E(0) z⁴ / (z² + r²)² which leads to the following iluminance pattern, as a function of the distance r to the center of the spot: r (m) E (lx) 0 318 0.
I'm diving into the intimidating world of color darkroom prints (RA-4). I've heard some things (no safelight, needs to be the correct temperature, and so on).
I've shoot some Ilford HP5 + on a Mamiya 645 1000s for the first time. After scanning the negatives i noticed some strange things all over the images, big white dots (most prominent in the sky) like rain.
There are two hard limits on how fast a lens can be: The first is a thermodynamic limit. Then, the infinitesimal area dS on the image plane is conjugated with an infinitesimal portion of the object having a solid-angular size dΩ = dS/f 2.
There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.

What SHOULD it do A 35 mm f/1. Your experience will vary with circumstance, luck, impact surface and angle that the camera hits.

I want to select image sensors for a particular application. One term that I have come across regularly in their datasheets is the CRA.

Look to see what website in Hong Kong uses. China seems to block content with its Great Firewall, sometimes at random and changes policies almost daily.
For an image sensor, CRA relates to the positioning of the microlenses. 0 Deg CRA means the microlenses are centered right on the pixels.
I've been changing lenses with the camera on as long as I've been using DSLRs and I know a lot of other photographers who do the same.
Does anyone know where can I exchange my new Canon lens? I bought it two days ago, but I realized that it is not suitable for me.
As described by FGR's article, sensors with a CRA of 0 have no shifting applied to the pixel microlenses. Sensors with a CRA of X have a micro-lens shift applied to distant pixels in the array designed to match wide-angle lenses with a matching CRA.

The moon is bathed in full sunshine, so the Sunny 16 rule should give you a good starting point. That is, set your shutter speed to the reciprocal of your ISO (so 1/200th if at ISO 200) and aperture to f/16.

Wow, there are so many things that can be affected... Here and here are nice writeups with interactive graphics illustrating the two most common types of SLR autofocus systems.

You can use Excel to calculate the angle of view and distances enscoped by this field of view. 2/2/180*PI()))*2*0. 36 meters) =(TAN(50.
The angle of view is calculated by trigonometry. Generally the focal length will be a known value as will be the measurements of the rectangular image.

What @tenmiles says is correct. I would make two modifications to make this more useful (which is what I played with before).
27mm The vertical angle of view is 27° The horizontal angle of view is 39. 6° The diagonal angle of view is 46. The formula I use in Excel f = focal length d = format dimension (sensor height or width) =((ATAN((d/2/f)))*180/PI())*2 Using the above for a 50mm lens mounted to a 35mm full frame measuring 24mm height by 36mm diagonal measure 43.
So I'm looking at the wikipedia article on Aperture, and I'm a bit confused. I understand aperture to be the diameter of the hole that lets light in.
If you want to hack something, probably the easiest way to do it is to buy a board-level system such as a Raspberry Pi and add a camera module.
Here is a link to a great hack of controlling a Canon 5D mark 2 with a Raspberry PI. It puts the R-PI in a battery/grip so it looks normal.

The latest version of ExifToolGUI supports graphing and recursive search ! http://u88. n24. queensu. ca/exiftool/forum/index.
I have some images of which some look blurry, and the others look non-blurry. I'm trying to analyze the EXIF data of such images in order to determine why some images look blurry and why others don't.
For whatever reason, the ColorSpace tag is not very useful in EXIF. The only standard values are 1 (sRGB) and 65535 ("uncalibrated").
Recently I came across a bunch of weird JPEGs; here's one of them. I have no plans to print these images and I do not have access to Photoshop.

The best earplugs are the ones you have with you. It doesn't matter how well a set of earplugs blocks sound if you don't have them when you need them.
Have a look at "The Photographer's Eye". I found it superb and contains all the rules you can think of. http://www. amazon.
I'm referring to what's listed on Amazon under the configuration. Here's an example: https://www. amazon. com/Tamron-28-75mm-Aspherical-Digital-A09NII/dp/B001955P8W/ref=sr_1_4?
Scott Kelby I also follow Scott Kelby at http://www. scottkelby. com/blog/ I find that (apart from promoting his own training and books - which is not a bad thing) Scott gives a good load of news, and has a weekly guest blogger section, where another famous photographer writes an entry.
In addition to the tips you've listed in comments: Have the owners with the dogs. Dogs are pack animals, and they may be well adjusted but they might not be.

Wireless one is good too. http://www. amazon. com/Nikon-Wireless-Control-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00007EDZG/ref=sr_1_1? ie=UTF8s=electronicsqid=1281804189sr=8-1 When i bought it, it was actually cheaper than the wired one.
That sounds like a great environment for using a reflector. They are cheap, and it is amazing how much a simple thing like that can change light.
First, clarifying some terms: MOLLE is the modular gear system. 0 MOLLE gear that only uses a singe PALS loop, or 2 adjacent PALS loops, would connect just fine to the Lowepro SlipLock loops.
Scott Kelby has many recipes in his Digital Photography books showing a photo and recipe, how to shoot such photo. I like the books as the tutorials are written in common language and really practical.

For anyone else who stumbles across this question, I found the FiveK dataset (from MIT/adobe) to be quite useful: https://data.
I discovered an artifact on a shot when I printed a large blowup of a tight crop. ---- Edit 2 ---- I compared an uncropped image on both "Aftershot" and "Darktable" for alignment in order to attempt to identify which 2-pixel shift is in error.
This is a bug in Corel's implementation of OpenCL Hardware GPU usage. The underlying problem is that Corel's OpenCL implementation shifts the exported layout by 2-pixels (approximately) in X  Y compared to other RAW to JPG (TIF too) conversions.
I would recommend the higher CPU in this case. The 610 is a bare bones "desktop" card that isn't really any better than the 4000.
You can get VirtualBox to give the guest Windows OS access to the GPU via 2D and 3D acceleration. On the VM you wish to use, right click to get the pop-up menu, select Settings, then Display.

I noticed that when I'm working with spot healing tool the cursor sometimes wouldn't respond or the brush overlay would stay for few seconds before applying the adjustment.
There is no simple answer to that because : The same GPU in 2 differents systems doesn't give the same performance. It depends on a lot of things (BUS speed, to name the most obvious, thus the motherboard) You need to compare the OpenCL versions supported by both GPU drivers and check if Photoshop use them.
What processing application do you use ? Its worth checking that it actually uses GPU (graphics processor), not all do.

I'll instantiate with portraits of these US Supreme Court justices: Stephen Johnson Field (November 4, 1816 – April 9, 1899) Rufus W.

for Pentax Cameras, there are two free possibilities: PK_Tether (freeware) which should work with: Pentax k-x, K7, K5, k-r, K20D, K10D, K200 - while the K-x and K-r are entry level, but very good cameras for the price second is pkTriggerCord (opensource) - which is for windows and linux which should fully support Pentax K-x, Pentax K10D (Samsung GX-10), Pentax K20D (Samsung GX-20), Pentax istDS, Pentax K200D, Pentax K-7, Pentax K-r, Pentax K-5, Pentax K-m/K2000 and limited support for istD, istDS2, istDL, K110D, K100D I have Pentax K-x and I am surely going to try both programs :-)
I'm going whale watching with a Pentax K5, I'm thinking of using a Pentax 60-250mm f/4 ED DA* SDM lens only as I don't want to change lenses while out at sea.
I have an old Pentax ME SUPER with three lenses, all of which have manual focus rings and no autofocus motors. Do new Pentax DSLRs have built-in focus motors that can deal with old lenses?
Just returning to Pentax, there are a handful of lenses I've found superb (going from wide to tele): DA 15, Tamron SP 10-24, Tamron SP 17-50, DA 40, DA 70, DA* 50-135 (newer version, older have had problems with bad SDM motors, that are prone to fail, also used in the DA16-50, I believe), Tamron 70-200/2.8.
Here are some example dosages; where would looking through the viewfinder for an hour fit? http://xkcd. com/radiation/ I read that lens makers used to use radioactive glass to increase the refractive index property of their lenses.

It should also be noted that the conversion rate between Rems and Seiverts is 1 mR = 10 µSv. So if a chest x-ray is 10mR (according to the article @rfusca linked), thats about 100µSv.

Many of the answers above compare the 24-105 Mark I to the 18-135 legacy version and find the 18-135 to be worse. However, when I compared the 24-105 Mark 1 to the 18-135 STM, I'm not seeing much of a difference.
If you're concerned at max aperture, the 70-200/2. 8 is sharper at f/2.8. http://www. the-digital-picture. com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops.

You can only avoid it by avoiding to use the small aperture, or by getting a camera with larger sensor (such as a 12MP full frame, which can handle at least ~F11, maybe even F14).
A 70-200 L lens is pretty much epic. com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops. the-digital-picture. Lens=404Camera=453Sample=0FLI=4API=1LensComp=104CameraComp=453SampleComp=0FLIComp=4APIComp=1 280mm: http://www.
I have the Canon 18-135 lens (purchased when I upgraded to the Canon T2i from my Canon XTi). I like the range and the lens weight is certainly convenient.
You need a dimmer - like this 1000W version from Impact. https://www. bhphotovideo. com/bnh/controller/home? A=detailsO=Q=c3api=1876%2C65681218442%2C%2Cgclid=Cj0KCQiA38jRBRCQARIsACEqIet9RZXxpP48UgZOp-efi6czCJmM0Rze1G227LEqqwz783mF5bID6WgaAiUFEALw_wcBis=REGpcur=CADsku=755346
Take an FF body and a crop body, with similar MP rating - and the FF body will give a sharper image of the same object.

So I think it is just a matter of "add to cart" on the Sigma page. Lens=829Camera=453Sample=0FLI=0API=2LensComp=121CameraComp=0FLIComp=0APIComp=0 Compare bokeh here: http://www.

Of the four Canon zooms I have within arms reach at the moment: I had already noticed it in the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS a long time ago.
The most significant difference between the newer TS-E 50mm f/2. com. 8 at this listing by allphotolenses. There's a small version of the MTF chart released by Canon for the TS-E 45mm f/2.
There's a reason no one makes a 24-200mm FF lens. 5-6. 3 Di II VC is an APS-C only lens. It wouldn't work on your full frame 6D.
