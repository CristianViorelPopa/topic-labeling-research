Iterate over what? I guess that is the point. To 'iterate' is to repeat something, say, an action, so we can iterate a procedure, or we can iterate over x, or iterate through x.
Your question is a little confusing because you ask about "a vector of signals," but you don't use those words in your example.

Are there any specific rules for articles before the word zero? Thanks! "a zero magnetization" or "the zero magnetization" or "zero magnetization"?
The answer may depend on the first language. The way you think of the situation. Prepositions are always subjective. Firstly know the connection between subject and landmark Here the subject is Sheila and landmark is facebook.
Zero is can be used to indicate a counted quantity whereas null cannot. In math you can have a set with no items in it (a null set) or you can have a set with a zero in it ({ 0 }) which are not the same.

"Brother/sister-in-law" is common U.S. English usage to refer to the spouses of your spouse's siblings. I have four brothers-in-law -- my sister's husband, my husband's brother, and my husband's sisters' husbands.
The sister to a husband becomes the wife's sister-in-law. If the sister in-law was to marry a woman, would she also become the wife's sister-in-law?
For example: Brother to brother: "We are brothers. We are siblings" Son to father: "We are ________. " I do not know of a word in English to express parent-child relations like that other than in terms of one to the other (i.e.
Your brother's wife, no matter what his age, is called a sister-in-law. Your sister's husband is a brother-in-law. As far as I know, there's no specific term if your sibling is a god brother or god sister, other than god sister's husband or god brother's wife.
So basically, my mom recently remarried to a man with one daughter from a previous marriage. Obviously, she's my step-sister.

"Is anyone up there sober?! What does this sentence mean? I am uncertain of meaning, or implied meaning of 1. "audibly virginal and entitled."
I haven't seen someone offer the word anal (or anal-retentive): The term anal-retentive (also anally retentive), commonly abbreviated to anal, is used conversationally to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that the obsession becomes an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person.
Someone who is "anal retentive" is a good fit and conveys the speaker's annoyance quite effectively. Wikipedia describes it thus: The term anal retentive (also anally retentive), commonly abbreviated to anal, is used to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that the obsession becomes an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person. .
Etymonline states: Anal-retentive first attested 1957, in psychological jargon. According to Wikipedia, which does a much more thorough job of explaining than I will, the term comes from the psychological work of Dr.
You are correct. They staged an interview where he pretended to be Sigmund Freud. Given that he doesn't mention a script, it seems that he was considered to be such an expert on Freud that it was felt he could play the part and answer questions as if he, himself, were Freud.

Let me try: It's widely known that the name "JavaScript" is trademarked by Oracle (formerly by Sun, and prior to that by Netscape).
What was formerly a trademark of Netscape? Sun? It is widely known that the name Javascript is a trademark now the property of Oracle but once owned by Sun (a trademark registered by Netscape).
What matters is that some of these terms are trademarked, and so, must be written in the way the trademark holders require.

The following are correct. This is his pencil. / This is my pencil. The following are wrong. This pencil is his. / This pencil is mine.
Thus, "Wet Floor" is a better caution than "Slippery Floor". "Wet Floor" is easier to translate into other languages than "Slippery Floor".
I have the tendency to equate "mine" as something like "hers" and "his". But I am not sure if this is correct. Which is correct?
Question 1 - She doesn't need to say "the beans", because it really doesn't matter which beans she's getting. Whether Aki gives her those beans, or some different beans, the question would still be the same.
However, no French speaker thinks of it that way — it's just the way to say "please". ) A "pure" English alternative might be, "The favor of your reply is appreciated."

Atom is a countable noun. Hydrogen is a mass noun. Hydrogen does not have the same meaning as hydrogen atom. Hydrogen atom is another way to say atom of hydrogen (just like ice cube is another way to say cube of ice).
What is the type (adjective, noun, etc. ) of the word atom in hydrogen atom? I think that atom here does not qualify hydrogen in any way and we can use it or not, and the meaning of the word hydrogen will not change.
Kinship terms in English begin with the first common direct ancestors. It gets a bit tricky when people are of different generations.
A child of a sibling of your parents is a first cousin. A grandchild of a sibling of your grandparents is a second cousin.
It's very easy to determine the relationship in English. First, find your common ancestor. Siblings have the same father, cousins have the same grandfather, etc.

I was wondering how to determine what an attributive clause modifies? Does "which combines neoclassical methods and Keynesian approach macroeconomics" modify "the neoclassical synthesis"?
The rule is to parenthesize the second item. So, for example, Bits of RNA (ribonucleic acid) mediate the conversion of genetic information into amino acids.
Keep in mind that genetic code, unlike ASCII code, is not a one to one code. For example, GGG, GGA, GGC, and GGT all correspond to Glycine.
While there is overlap, there is definitely domain unique to each. A nook could be an inside corner, but it connotes seclusion, and may denote "coziness.

It isn't just about vision. For instance, an optic nerve aids you visually... not optically. An optical illusion means that the optic mechanics of your eye/brain are illuded.
As far as I know the meaning of "perception of people" is "perception about people" but when I want to say "people's perception, can I also change it to "perception of people" form with the same meaning??
It seems to me that "optical" relates more to the mechanics of light and vision, whereas "visual" is a much broader term.
While the punctuation in the quote is acceptable, placing a comma after the word "hallucinations" would make the sentence a bit clearer (to me, at least.
A "case in point" is something like a relevant example. How does the phrase break down literally, though? What about "case in point"?

The standard phrase or idiom is tug at one's heartstrings: one's heartstrings used in reference to one's deepest feelings of love or compassion: the kitten's pitiful little squeak tugged at her heartstrings NOAD Also, NOAD defines tug thus: pull (something) hard or suddenly Thus, when something tugs at (pulls at) your heartstrings, it deeply affects your feelings in some way (a prick, a pang, etc).

The only two meanings I know for "miss" are: the one as in "miss a chance" and the one as "think about". where the first "miss" meant "don't encounter", and the second "miss" meant "think about".

I understand that when trying to describe a person who has a resemblance to another, the common term is spitting image.
"Angela Merkel's premiership unravelled all of sudden. " "Angela Merkel's premiership collapsed all of sudden. " "Angela Merkel lost her premiership suddenly.
Or so I think... "in my pajamas" -> Inside your pajamas whereas to avoid ambiguity, one possibility would be: "wearing my pajamas" -> shot the elephant when you were in your pajamas Basically the funny thing here is that the elephant is not in your pajamas but the sentence somehow ends up painting that picture.

Betty learned that Albert telephoned after Isaiah visited. Can anybody explain whether "after Isaiah visited" tell us: (1) when Betty learned something about Albert or (2) when Albert telephoned?
Correct usage of ‘on’, ‘at’ and ‘in’ from a foreigner’s point of view I don't know which of these three sentences is preferable: India launched its Agni PSLV 5 missile at Chandipur, about 15 km from Balasore.
It is considered to be a fallacy. Such an attack is called an ad hominem. From wikipedia: Ad hominem (Latin for "to the man" or "to the person"), short for argumentum ad hominem, is where an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.
There is a slight difference in your first two sentences. First, the difference between "and" and "or": 1) I am against twablulation except in the cases of delivery, attack, and colorization of a twibble.

Neither is standard. The first is wrong; the second is borderline-acceptable. "Acme construction specializes in quality remodeling and renovation.
I'm looking for recommendations on how best to abbreviate the following demographic income range: 1 below 3,000,000 Japanese yen (JPY) 2 between 3,000,000 and 4,999,999 JPY 3 between 5,000,000 JPY and 7,999,999 JPY 4 8,000,000 JPY and above Would it be correct to rewrite as: 1 below 3M JPY 2 between 3M and 4.
) The set 10-course meal, which changes monthly, is 3,680 yen (about $40, assuming that 91 yen is equal to a dollar). However, the wording of the explanatory quote above is not as good as the wording in your example; the article's wording is more natural.
Wiktionary: to refurbish To rebuild or replenish with all new material; to restore to original (or better) working order and appearance.
All you have to say is 1 up to 3m yen 2 up to 5m yen 3 up to 8m yen 4 over 8m yen It's Just That Simple. (Of course, use the yen symbol, JPY, yen, Yen, or whatever is appropriate.

I've got these sentences, which meanings are correct (my interpretations are in brackets): Use of only: (1) Only in 1996, Ford sold a rebadged Mazda 626 GV over here as its rebranded Japanese mid-size stationwagon.
Only in 1996, Ford sold a rebadged Mazda 626 GV over here as its rebranded Japanese mid-size stationwagon. ) Correct. ) More or less.
Both terms mean different things: In "flavour savour", "savour" is to 'enjoy by tasting'. "Flavour savour" can't be used on a beard, because we can't savour with our beards or goatees.
Is it midsentence or mid-sentence? Onelook doesn't say. Hence, we put a space after the hyphen. Also, is it mid- to late 50s, mid-to-late 50s, or mid to late 50s?
The following are all acceptable English. They mean slightly different things: "Sporting a beard" as Peter Shor says, means to "display or wear" a beard, usually ostentatiously.

Can this possibly be a correct phrase: Green green green green green. I got it from a Russian demotivator: I wonder if there is any possible meaning, or whether it shouldn’t be more like this: Green green greens green green.
List form: In your question, you provided an ordered list. In list form, I would only use the colon. Try to keep the colon as close as possible to what it is listing about.
In this example: bla bla bla phrase such as even if something like this doesn’t exist bla bla bla. What can I use to inject my phrase in the middle of the sentence?
I would use 'red buses and cabs, and black buses and cabs'. 'Red and black buses and cabs' to me means buses and cabs which are all painted in both red and black, perhaps red up to the bottom of the windows and black above.
You've probably blown up by now. Cut the red-green wire. These were either not prohibited at all (if the expert meant red-green), or not prohibited individually.

It isn't a very common usage but it would technically be grammatically correct. Here are my two. Where are your crayons?
I think "time zone" is most common. 6 million results, but timezone -"time zone" gives only 6. 3 million. Google backs me up in this case - googling "time zone" -timezone (that is, websites with only time zone in them) gives 12.
Odorous? (Odourous in the UK) (Same in the UK, see below) Scented if the smell was added (Strawberry-scented envelopes, but not scented strawberries) or smelly if the smell is pungent or unpleasant (smelly cheese can be good, smelly socks aren't).
As a spin-off from this comment: If a human exclaims something like "ouch! ", I believe it's considered an interjection.

So: "... " or "... " This is not the most common usage for recte, but I think it would convey the message. The conventional way is the following: "...
Based on a parallel with my children's use of "jinx" I would propose: ... It might not be correct, but it is at least extensible :-) ...
A discussion of adjective ordering is the right approach here I think, but... To me, “local crumbed scallops” would be already-crumbed scallops obtained locally; “crumbed local scallops” would be scallops obtained locally and then crumbed after being obtained.
What is the proper use of [square brackets] in quotes? Parentheses or square brackets? When I add information beside a word in a Bible verse, what bracket should I use?

I think people are just being accurate. When they know the tumors in their lungs are cancerous, they accurately refer to it as "lung cancer" or "cancer of the lung".
The definition of irony can be so elusive. Let's examine the two pieces of your example: Linux is the most secure OS. Linux is used for the most effective hacking.
The link to Torvalds' pronunciation is broken, but I have it on my hard drive. It is a quote from Torvalds himself (I meant Himself, sorry).
Both are acceptable, depending on the context: as highlighted in other answers, a Linux developer updating Linux will use "on", while a Linux user will work "in" Linux.
Linux. Many people pronounce it "LYE-nucks" (I do) but, as it's based on the Swedish name Linus (Linus Torvalds is Finnish but speaks Swedish).

Nausea, by itself, is the urge to vomit. I had really bad nausea. Nauseated is the verb meaning to become affected with nausea.
From Wikipedia: A zigzag is a pattern made up of small corners at variable angles, though constant within the zigzag, tracing a path between two parallel lines; it can be described as both jagged and fairly regular.
I don't quite understand how one should use the expression "exported from somewhere". What does it mean when an item is exported from a given place?
According to http://www. thefreedictionary. I agree, it does sound better; but, naturally, disable is used as a verb. Hence "disable time" suggests that a subject is trying to disable time (whatever that means).
If you are asking about the sentence Does this also mean that if exports increase and nothing happens to imports, will that lead to Net Exports increasing?

Surely the discussion here is not about what is correct, it is just labeling. Soured Cream simply means it has been soured (made sour), past tense.
Looking at the Corpus of Contemporary American English, I notice that the most used phrase is sour cream. Looking at the entry for sour (the verb) in the NOAD, I find the following definition: make or become sour: [with object]: water soured with tamarind | (as adjective soured): soured cream | [without object]: a bowl of milk was souring in the sun.
Ok, if I say "this car is too expensive" or "this car is very expensive", then I can not express the connotation of "expensive".

Earphones/earbuds are those worn in the ears without a headband. While they come in pairs, one can have an earphone/earbud in one ear, leaving the other dangling.
Can you wear headphones (plural) in only one ear? Or would I have to use a singular form? EDIT: I want to show that even though she has a set of headphones, she's only wearing a singular piece of it in one ear.
They pull their ears would be grammatically correct. However, it does not convey whether the theys pull one or two ears.
Consider the following: I pull my ear. He pulls his ear. She pulls her ear. What would be the correct form of "ear" for plural subjects?
As fumblefingers mentions, the answer to the question is contextual.

The most common ways I've seen are writing out the words: sad trombone :( trombone Or to use the onomatopoeic Wah, Wah, Wah, Wahhhhhhh … Womp, Womp, Womp, Wommmmmp… (at the behest of several commenters) Or to combine them: sad trombone: wah, wah, wah, wahhhhh …
" ? is it possible? Thanks in advance :) I think these two questions are ok to use with Should  Shouldn't and it's same meaning can you tell me why to do?
We have a word for telling something that is not truthful, a.k.a. to lie, but why is there no conjugatable term for telling the truth?
Is a question that starts with "What need is there to" grammatically correct? If so, is there a difference in meaning or nuance between that clause and "Is there a need to"?

With the slightest bit of context, I think these would be understood unambiguously. For the owner, use "renting out", and be definite ("my apartment"): I am renting out my apartment in New York.
But if a house was divided up into units, they would each be considered apartments. Condo, which is short for condominium, is mostly the subset of apartments where the individual living units are owned by different people.
"I'm in the room" is the phrase you should be going with. If you're talking about the room for the first time with person X, use 'a', as in "In a room which is on so and so floor".
What is the plural form of “iPad 2”? When can an adjective be postposed? I'm curious particularly with iPod Touch and iPad Mini The plural would be iPod Touches and iPad Minis, or iPods Touch and iPads Mini
If you are a tenant, you would be "renting" an apartment. If you are a landlord, you would be "letting" an apartment. Sometimes landlords will use the word "rent.

Hoo boy. Which is as far as I can get without knowing more about what the heck a nonrecourse debt is, and what does it mean to be subject to it.
I've just found BrE sneak/sneaked/sneaked and AmE sneak/snuck/snuck. Are there more of these deviations? Generally, lists of irregular verbs in grammars are so poor that they show only half of what there is to know.
second thought or reconsideration can be an alternatives. Rethink: noun: a reassessment of something, especially one that results in changes being made: (a last-minute rethink of their tactics) rethink Rethink can be used as a noun, afterthought.
Having found the publication you referenced, I noticed two words that you left out that clear up the sentence a bit. ) In (somewhat) plain English: Take the property that is subject to nonrecourse debt and find the Fair Market Value.
Quite simply "not in excess". Since excess means: An amount of something that is more than necessary, permitted, or desirable: and in excess means: Exceeding the proper amount or degree (from ODO) So if something is in excess then it is more than sufficient.

Usage examples from the same dictionary I grabbed the definitions: the pure apprehension of the work of art she must have been laboring under the misapprehension that you are nice
If you are in the UK, you could use 'skint' adjective, British Slang. 1 - having no money; penniless. www. dictionary. com Thus "I am skint from buying useless medicine.
I have a program that does a job on batches of 100 items. I'd like a single word for the batches of batches. I'm not looking for just any old synonym of "batch", but for a word which includes the sense of being batched at a higher level - though if such a word doesn't exist for "batch" and does exist for a synonym, I'd be happy with the pair.
Apprehension is not usually used as the opposite of misapprehension. Misapprehension is another word for misunderstanding - "A mistaken belief about or interpretation of something".
If you meant she was in ill humour, then the word is disgruntled. If be-gruntled meant anything at all, it would mean that she had become gruntled.

I disagree with @baquiano to some extent. So in that respect it differs from cargo. For one thing, shipment can also refer to the goods themselves, as in The shipment of machine parts was due to arrive yesterday.
Your sentence is This is a ship-shipping ship, shipping shipping ships. The last shipping is an adjective, describing what kind of ships are being shipped.
The sentence as you use it pertains a little different meaning than the alternatives. It is perfectly OK to say The rows should be copied.

Source: Dictionary. com What you gave me is a paucity! smallness or insufficiency of number; fewness. I think this word would be perfectly appropriate here, although it's a noun: Paucity [paw-si-tee] / noun smallness of quantity; scarcity; scantiness: a country with a paucity of resources.
You have probably already checked the dictionary for definitions of paucity, scarcity, and dearth. They all basically mean "a lack of something," and the fact that each definition references the others attests to their interchangeable utility.
While in a conversation about a place xyz which is facing water scarcity, if another place abc is also having water scarcity, which sentence would be correct:- I know xyz has water scarcity, but is abc too having water scarcity?
What is the letter U called when it says the /w/ sound in words like suede and penguin? I've read that y and w are semivowels but the U in suede and penguin doesn't really conform to the definition of a semivowel, and experts don't recognise it as a semivowel, so I was wondering if there was another category that I don't know about.

All existing English words having both -less and -ness endings are of the XXXlessness sort; there are none of the *XXXnessless variety.
For Hofstadter fans, this has the bonus of being self-referential. My suggestion is nom d'etre. Your sentence would be: This new development is crying out for a nom d'etre.
NOAD defines anti-Semitism thus: anti-Semitism hostility or prejudice against Jews And here is the relevant entry from the Online Etymology Dictionary: anti-Semitism also antisemitism, 1881, from Ger.
Suffixes -ness and -ity are roughly synonymous, but they have different etymologies. There are two roughly synonymous suffixes, -ness and -ity, which are typically used for forming abstract nouns from adjectives, as in example below.

(I'll use “spooky-graphoid” as a randomly made-up technical term and “saturated” as a random adjective from the scientific vernacular.
It is my understanding that, within the aerospace industry, "on orbit" means "in the correct orbit" (such as "on target" or "on path").
Earth is capitalized when it's a name (proper noun of our planet), and not when it's a noun (referring to a planet, its soil, its land...

The premise is flawed, in my view. The package sells "cheapest" would be more correctly stated as "sells most cheaply" or "the package is the cheapest".

As Jasper said, it is used in English to connect to things that are closely related. The word cum is Latin for 'with', as in cum laude, which means "with honour".
I am not sure exactly how the British system ranks their degrees, but their is some discussion of it here. At the high school I attended, there were two ways to graduate: with or without honors.
The most widely-recognized English phrases for these are, ironically, in Latin. " You're free to use either the Latin or the English translations, as both will be understood.
The choice between wreath and garland is simple: a wreath is round, while a garland is a long string. It is generally intended to be worn on the head.

What is the correct term to describe the words in the following sequence: primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, denary, duodenary, etc.
The terms are "Cardinal" and "Ordinal" and "Distributive". One, two, three, etc. are "Cardinal Numbers. " First, second, third, etc.
I was curious to know what comes after: Primary, secondary, tertiary, ... This Oxford website says it is "quartenary, quinary, ...
In British English negative questions with the verb have (when it's a lexical verb and not an auxiliary) can be formed in two ways.
primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, denary, duodenary, etc. Currently I'm considering replacing word_or_phrase with higher-order, higher-tier or n-ary, with the intended meaning of "from tertiary onwards".

Common Digits Although it was not always this way, at one point in the history of the Unicode Standard, they made explicit that a digit was only usable for a base-10 numeric character used to compose big-endian numbers.
No, an emoticon is a symbol, not punctuation. Unicode clearly differentiates symbols such as math symbols and currency symbols, from punctuation, such as open or close punctuation.
Obviously the word "sign" is countable noun in this context. One sign. Two signs. But NO SIGN means zero sign. I'd like to say: The calm, balmy evening air showed no sign of the carnage that would ensue.
Programmers have been known to call it ‘hook’. Edit: Modern programmers have a lot more hooky things to cope with than just the old QUESTION MARK from antediluvian typewriter keyboards.
The standard, but not very satisfying, answer is that you use an EN DASH (codepoint U+2013) as a higher-order HYPHEN (codepoint U+2010).

"spew vitriol" is a metaphor; vitriol is a liquid acid, so "spewing" it makes sense: to "spew" means to vomit or spit forth a large amount of liquid.
e.g. The context was personA: Live slugs! personB: Waive off! Waive off! This is just a practice run! I understand that when you waive something you forego it or give it up.
Spewing vitriol is a rather extreme form of expression. "Spewing vitriol" is concise. In contrast, I'd say that ... It carries slightly less weight, which is what you asked about.
They do not mean the same (to finally answer the original question). The question is confusing since both the odd's bodkins and bare bodkin appear in Shakespeare's Hamlet.
Yes, this is grammatical. The first noun is acting like an adjective. As Colin notes, you can't always put a noun in a the same position as an adjective bu it does work as 'N N'.

05 seconds). Ordinal numbers: 100th = one hundredth... 200th = two hundredth... Fractions: 1/100 = one one-hundredth...
Since the numbers in phone numbers are grouped, it's more clear to the listener if you say them in the same groups with an optional pause between the last pairs of digits.
To me, "five hundredth" means 1/500 or 0. 002. But I've seen people use it to mean 0. 05 in sports (e.g. I think 0. 05 should really be "five one-hundredth".
This is a matter of personal preference and/or a style guide, but here's what I recall from one usage authority (The Right Word at the Right Time, published by the Reader's Digest).
What you need to think about here is what it is that there are five of. If you look at a sentence like five cans of paint for example, there are five cans.

I have a friend who says sentences like, "Santa Claus deserves booed". I would say, "Santa Claus deserves to be booed".
If corpus evidence is anything to go by, then Santa Claus is more popular than Father Christmas in the US, and Father Christmas is more popular than Santa Claus in the UK, but by a very much smaller degree.
Santa Claus is a man, right? In this case, he may not be fine with the fact that people call him Santa, which is the Spanish and Portuguese word for female saint names.
When it comes to cities and boats named after saints, it seems that "Santa" is always female and "San" is always male. e.g.
Is the name Father Christmas used in the US or is it mainly Santa Claus (and Santa)? Does Father Christmas sound unusual or out of place if it was used in the US?

This is mainly a response to Noldorin's answer; I don't have enough reputation points to comment directly. com agrees: "An ellipse always has two axes of reflection; an oval has one or more.
I have a bigger issue with this sentence. When did VPN become a verb? " I believe all of these should be essentially equally correct.

Demure can function this way. It can mean actually modest, or affectedly modest. And the ambiguity can be handy. 1 : RESERVED, MODEST 2 : affectedly modest, reserved, or serious : COY https://www.
What about using a phrase with the word, trap? Set a trap Lay a trap Lure [animal/person] into a trap These are all very common and easily understood idiomatic expressions which might very well fit your needs.
Or bear-trap memory? Any why "bear trap"? I googled and saw a few examples. But none is very explanatory. An example of usage: ...
Its called a Trap. Trap house can be a house or club or building that hosts delinquents or druggies. Also make and sell drugs from these traps.
If "an unsprung trap" can mean "a trap not fitted with springs" and also "a trap which has not activated", then generally the second would be the more pertinent information and the more likely meaning, unless you're having a discussion with a trap maker, in which case, well, sometimes things are just ambiguous.

Are both It's ideal for you and It's ideal for yourselves grammatically correct? If not, why certain persons use 'you' while other ones use 'yourselves'?
Which is correct, you and I or you and me? It is they who lied or it is them who lied? Which one is grammatically correct: It was me who called you.
More clear vs Clearer, when to use more instead of -er Which of these two terms is correct? If they are both correct, are they identical in usage and meaning, or is one of the words more appropriate for some usages than the other?
In time  versus on time On time vs. in time I am confused between usages of "On" and "In" in following sentence: Let the task be done _____ time.
Which is correct, you and I or you and me? since "All I need is I" seems not proper here whereas "All I need is you" does.

Microblog is the only verb that refers specifically to short public postings to social networking services like Twitter.
Consider this text: JavaScript contains weird parts and some people like the idea of being able to avoid having to understand those parts.
As the others have said, there is nothing ungrammatical about the construction. I found it perfectly clear, although it does require a little mental gymnastics to keep the sense clear.
I search rather than Google and vacuum rather than Hoover. Is there a short (single syllable? ), established, generic term I can use in case I switch to identi.

He opposes the use of drugs. He discourages against the use of drugs. He is critical of those who use drugs. He is an advocate of the War on Drugs.
To summarize: Urban dictionary is not very reliable. specifically, the example there of implying reverse psychology, is not defining, but rather a very incidental use.
Drug A is administered concurrently with or sequentially to Drug B. I want to say in a formal manner that Drug A and Drug B are administered either at the same time or at different times, but I don’t want to say whether A or B comes first.
I googled "Gravy Etymology" and found this link which says that "gravy is a subset of sauces made from meat essence" and it goes on to say that Italian-Americans use the word to refer to tomato-and-meat sauce.
[Gravy] is an Italian American invention. I also found at Serious Eats, Sunday gravy: anyone have a great recipe for it?

I'm a bit confused. Is it correct to use "me too" and "I too"? (Also with other pronouns. ) For example, if I want to say that Juan gives a present to Ana and I give a present to Ana: Juan gives a present to Ana, [me/I] too.
It stands for "(advanced) skill". There are lots of similar constructions, such as "Script-Fu", "Google-Fu", and so on.
Aragorn uses Ranger-fu to figure out that Sam and Frodo have taken a boat. It comes from kung-fu, most commonly seen as google-fu
Simply stick with the pronoun you would have used if the statement was made about your action and your action alone. For example if you will say: Juan gave a present to Ana and I gave a present to Ana.
It means “mastery of Google” or “Googling skill”. ORIGIN from Chinese gōngfú, from gōng ‘merit’ + fú ‘master.’ It is modelled after kung fu: kung fu (noun): a primarily unarmed Chinese martial art resembling karate.

Spiderman is not an ordinary word while punisher is. People will know that a punisher is someone who punishes, but what in the world is a spiderman?
High is indeed the collocation of choice here. Big or large don't sound idiomatic. Both the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) and the British National Corpus (BNC) confirm this.
Brie, the cheese, is a proper noun in France, where the use of the term is defined by law; elsewhere it’s a common noun.
a storm. Now I would like to express that I think that there maybe is/was/... a storm, for example because I saw all the fallen trees.
The usage in (the) question is in the alternative meaning which is surprisingly in contrast to the calm weather one . This was the calm of the storm, the eye of the storm.

For evidence, consider this Ngram. Today, people generally use the singular compass rather than pair of compasses for the instrument for drawing circles.
Just as we needn't refer to the above using pair of, there's nothing wrong with referring to a pair of scissors as simply scissors.
It was a hack. And to indicate that its a "hacker's code", use Its hacky code. instead. From Wikitionary Hacky : Using, or characterised by, hacks
A compass, like scissors, tweezers, glasses, pliers, tongs, bellows, and calipers, is an instrument that is made up of two near-identical pieces that are attached to each other.
This is one of those occasions when one realizes the unique abilities of each language. English with most number of words among the world languages, does not have a word for each member of a pair.

Let's say I am quoting the verse "Do you like cheese? " from the Book Of Cheese. Is it: As it is written, "Do you like cheese?
I tried to find this rule explicitly on several grammar sites, but did not find it. A "not only" sentence does not normally need a comma as the "not only" and "but also" are correlative pairs.
Cheddar is both the cheese, and the city where the recipe originates. Speaking of corn fritters, I've never met a fritter that wasn't made with cornmeal; I'm TOLD they exist...

" A "very dirty" martini would, I'm guessing, contain a lot of brine. ) It can be garnished with an olive or a lemon twist.
Dirty refers to adding olive brine to a martini. I would presume that she considers adding all this extra olive flavour to be messing up a martini, or fucking it (as a shortening of "fucking up" or "fucking with").
Although frequently used incorrectly in English, the borrowed Italian word paparazzi should be used for a group, while paparazzo is one intrusive celebrity photographer.

So far so good and I agree. The Grammarist says I should use rife with rather than ripe with. But is there an exception for ripe with opportunity?
In cyber space you can do all kinds of cyber activity, including cyber crime, cyber bullying, cyber security, cyber auctions, cyber attacks, work at your cyber job, obey cyber law, bend to the whim of cyber police, enjoy a journey in cyberquest (jk), find a new job through cyber recruitment, avoid cyber terrorism, attend a cyber university, accumulate cyber wealth, all while making cyber friends.
I suggest you take the word jaunt and attach an adjective of your choosing to it. an invigorating jaunt a meditative jaunt a refreshing jaunt a mind-clearing jaunt a re-balancing jaunt a re-centering jaunt Jaunt, by itself, suggests a pleasurable walk or perambulation; by combining it with an adjective you conjoin pleasure with mental refreshment.
What is the difference between saying "during summer" and "during the summer"? As in: I work during the summer. I work during summer.

The second means that we do flagrantly ignore and disregard modernity, and that is the reason we shine and prevail. The two mean slightly different things; the first sentence means we would shine and prevail if only we were to flagrantly ignore and disregard modernity, but since we don't, we aren't shining or prevailing.
Is it correct and/or does it change the meaning of the original sentence? "While everyone chafes under any ethical and moral systems, we’d shine and prevail by flagrantly ignoring and disregarding modernity in favor of successes, results and growth.
Those are ligatures. In this case, the ligatures have been created for aesthetic reasons rather than practical ones, as the s and c characters would not merge with the t with normal kerning.
There are tons of œ ligatures in French like sœur (sister) and cœur (heart. ) What I've noticed is that in British English and American English some words are spelled differently, which leads me to believe that there was a ligature, as confirmed by Wikipedia (just now as you've sparked my interest on the subject).

It's a noun vs. adjective thing -- PRAWN in "pasta topped with prawns" is a noun; PRAWN in "prawn cocktail" is an adjective.
Not one word, but how about disposable dinnerware and flatware or disposable dinnerware and cutlery? Hence, it's not obvious one can do better than three words without inventing new words.
You already have the answer. I appended some text. Prepend: You prepend text before some other text. I prepended some text.
Mizzle is a dialect word for drizzle. Where and how often is it used? Please read the sentence I have found: There's mizzling and there's drizzle.
1) Is a pasta topped with actual calamari and prawns not a "calamari and prawns pasta" ? 2) Prawn is a noun and the plural is prawns right?

Something along the lines of "mark of distinction", "status symbol", "noble bearing" seems to have the connotations you are asking for, but they don't fit your example sentence.
" That's as far as we're going into the subject. " The term might have been of some such incident as a lad going into a store and saying, in all innocence, "I want a zoot.
Consider also "sangfroid" (which I've also seen as "sang-froid") - http://en. wiktionary. org/wiki/sangfroid From the French meaning "cold blood" it refers to staying calm in a difficult situation.
The two phrases are often used interchangeably, in a conversational context. But there is a difference in meaning between the two phrases, in accounting, specifically for cashiering and bookkeeping.
I'm confused about the structure of this sentence when I read this text: And that's why I start the businesses that I start, that's usually consumer brands, that have embedded in them the very best of my African culture.

'All believers respect God' means that if someone is a believer, then he respects God. Here, the word 'all' is used for emphasis, and the shorter 'Believers respect God' means essentially the same thing.
Example questions: If we say Socrates, Hippocrates, etc, why dont we say Aristoteles? Why Aristotle? What is the overlap between Y and I?
I don't believe in any deities. Therefore I am an atheist. But if I were to just express that I don't believe in say Zeus, would it be correct to say "I am atheistic towards Zeus"?
Use this tag for questions about how to capitalize correctly, or questions about a specific instance of capitalization.
God (with a capital letter) refers to the creator or supreme being worshipped by adherents of monotheistic religions. A (lower-case) god refers to any of the gods worshipped by adherents of polytheistic religions; Zeus, Krishna, Tara, Ra, Nut, Persephone, Thor, Kwan Yin and so on and so forth.

Because the verb 'peel' is a negative connotation already, to have peel and unpeel exist is just redundant. So to prefix 'un' to 'peel' as its noun form makes perfect sense because you're explaining that you're removing the peel of a fruit or vegetable.
Pare [verb]: to cut off the outer layer of something, using a sharp knife Pare the rind from the fruit. Skin [noun]: the natural outer cover of some fruits and vegetables, the word also has many other meanings.
In my opinion, "fruit" has a plural form. When one uses "fruit", it means a single fruit like mango, orange, and so on.
And also which verb should we use for each thing? For example: banana peel vs banana skin vs banana rind Which one should we use for each thing?
Fewer vegetables and fruit. I'll assume you're using fruit in its more common, uncountable sense. Less fruit and vegetables.

The "chai tea" usage would be understood but frowned upon in India. (wiki) My opinion: Chai (tea) is nothing but rechristening of the Indian chai for the export market under the name of chai tea.

What is the best way to explain to a learner of English how to choose between it's and its? Note the total absence of any possessive apostrophe.
"I like dogs" - I like all dogs. "I like this dog" - I like this specific dog. "I like dog" - I like 'dog' as a particular object.

Emphasis and meaning (and 'literal' meaning? ) can be different. Let's say you have some goats. Some of them are big goats, and a minority the big goats are prickly goats -- they have wiry hair that pricks you if you touch them.
Other words that could be used here are proclivity and propensity. Proclivity: natural or habitual inclination or tendency; propensity; predisposition: a proclivity to meticulousness.
The terms are different even though they can be interchangeably used a lot. Floor is where you get off or live. Story is a measurement of height.
Normally there is a slight difference between the ground floor and the first floor depending on a commercial or residential building.

It was much more common in centuries past to use different names in different languages than it is now. It would have been quite normal for this person to use language-specific names.
So why the usage of the term semi-colon, or half-colon, for a symbol part of which does not appear at all in the colon?
We've all been overwhelmed with work, or seen an underwhelming movie... but it occurred to me that I've never heard anyone use the root word, whelm.
The phrase can be interpreted as having an implicit as (as much as instead of much as), and read as If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be the same as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans.
Yes you can use colons for other uses besides a listing. In your example the colon indicates a more detailed answer or explanation will shortly follow.

I've seen cases where a noon-time meal is referred to as dinner, and the evening meal is called supper. There's also lunch around noon followed by dinner in the evening.
The original meaning of dinner was a noon meal (the most significant meal of the day). In most dialects it now means the evening meal, but some folks still refer to the noon meal as dinner and the evening meal as supper.
You usually use the phrase 'one of my' when you have multiple favorites. For example: Assume I like 3 restaurants namely: Restaurant A, Restaurant B, Restaurant C.
I'm from New Zealand. I don't think "supper" is very common, but when I stayed in a hall of residence at university in 1996, they served "supper" at around 9pm.
Additionally, the name for some meals varies around the world. In the UK (and please, any English correct me if I have this wrong!

It either has a scale (analog or digital) or a clutch that is set to release at a certain torque. A Wrench (spanner in BE) is to tighten or loosen a nut.
On the other hand, the noun "wrench" applies to things other than tools. See the Free dictionary definition of wrench. In my experience, which agrees with wikipedia "torque wrench" means a wrench which gives a controllable torque, either through measurement of the torque applied or due to a mechanism which prevents a torque greater than a given amount.
You are right that for is a coordinating conjunction, the first of the so-called FANBOYS. But you cannot move a coordinated clause (starting with a FANBOY) to the front of a sentence: I was hungry, so I ate.
I always thought that a spanner for tightening nuts was so called because the jaws of the spanner spanned the flat faces of the nut.
Given your example sentence, nuts and bolts is an idiom you could use. Nuts and bolts: The basic practical details Here are some examples of usage from Oxford Dictionaries Online: The nuts and bolts of making a movie...

The word is pessimist, a person who expects the worst. Mr X is a pessimist. Contrast with optimist. It is often said that while optimists are happier, pessimists are more often correct.
Here is how various dictionaries—starting with the 1756 edition of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary and ending with Merriam-Webster's Eleventh Collegiate Dictionary (2003)—have defined bicker and squabble over the past 250 years or so.
A QUARREL(L)ER - a person who quarrel(l)s. According to Collin's Dictionary https://www. dictionary. com/browse/quarrel : Quarrel(l) : to disagree angrily; squabble; wrangle : to end a friendship  as a result of a disagreement
How about lover's squabble? From Dictionary. com and Merriam-Webster, squabble and tiff mean more or less the same thing.

The arity of a function or operation is the number of arguments or operands that the function takes. N-ary: Nullary means 0-ary.
This is quite different from the actual meaning. Am I missing something? Does "all" actually mean "not all" in this context?
There's essentially one word, with two meanings and two spellings. The Wikipedia sections Carat(purity)#Derivation and Carat(mass)#Etymology agree: once upon a time, carob seeds, because of their reputation for uniform weight, were used as measures of weight.
From what I could find, the PMBOK is an IEEE standard, but it cannot be said that “IEEE has a PMBOK”. A Google search for “IEEE's PMBOK”, “IEEE's Project Management Body of Knowledge”, “IEEE PMBOK” and “IEEE Project Management Body of Knowledge” all returned few (and irrelevant) hits.
There’s a dictionary saying heft means weight, but what does heft mean in the phrase of “weight and heft”? Is it "weight and weight"?

Which is the correct way of separating two paragraphs? Vestibulum augue ligula, placerat eget orci dictum, blandit pharetra lectus.
What is a single word for a title and short paragraph? Phasellus sagittis dictum nisl. Duis ac dapibus diam. Maecenas porta non dolor in commodo.
The standard indicator of missing content is [... Phasellus condimentum commodo purus. Vestibulum eget adipiscing mi. Morbi in consequat urna.
Robert Bringhurst, in his seminal work The Elements of Typographic Style, has this to say: Set opening paragraphs flush left.
It means that XHTML is a subset of HTML. XHTML is the basis for a family of future document types, therefore: XHTML is in this family of documents these documents extend and subset HTML, therefore: XHTML subsets HTML, therefore: XHTML is a subset of HTML

'Legacy' is the adjectival form of 'legacy'. If you're hip enough, you can even use 'legacy' as the adverbial form of 'legacy'.
"Bacon". Because it is delicious and desirable, it is the opposite of Spam. Where Spam maybe UCE (unsolicited commercial email), Bacon might therefore also be of commercial nature but solicited.
I don't think there is a single word in English that captures the combined meaning of both words in the phrase "bad legacy".

The word "sequel" comes from the the Latin word sequela which means "that which follows" This Latin word is formed of two parts, "sequi" which is "to follow", and a suffix to make it a noun,"-ela".
You can pass the plugin’s options in here. The plugin’s options have been saved. I never know which option to choose. Can someone enlighten me?
Note that it's equally valid (though less specific) to say just "Options have been saved". In the second case you would say "The plugin's options have been saved.
Dunglison Med. The Oxford English Dictionary writes that it was first used in a now-obsolete sense in the 1600s: The action or process of seeing with one's own eyes; personal observation, inspection, or experience.
Sequel is from the Latin sequi ("to follow") and was presumably in use long before the modern concept of film and book sequels became so ingrained in popular culture.

Which expression is better? Sorry to disturb you at the weekends. G. Sorry to disturb you on the weekend. F. Sorry to disturb you at the weekend.
Personally, I would not talk about the weekend of the 24th: S_M_T_W_Th_F_S 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 I would say the weekend of the 22nd or 23rd.
That is why Sat and Sun are collectively known as the "weekEND". The 29th and the 30th would be the "weekend". (2) The dates from 24 through 30 comprise the "week of the 24th".
E.g. (from freedictionary), "on the 10th proximo" (10th of coming month). There is a word for this — proximo, meaning "in or of the next (coming) month".

I always like the old Wood Chuck. I am surprised that nobody said anything about it yet. He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, And chuck as much as a woodchuck would If a woodchuck could chuck wood.
" I am wondering if repetition, particularly of the word "wood", would display symbolism or any other kind of literary device.
Details: Woodchuck is used as an alternative name for groundhogs. (Can they? )) of Cree (Algonquian) otchek or Ojibwa otchig, "marten," the name subsequently transferred to the groundhog.
"Strongly" is okay in this sentence. To help clarify: It had a [strongly Protestant and unionist] identity. "Strongly" is modifying "Protestant and unionist" to compare it against a mildly Protestant/union identity.
What is the difference between the usage of dream of and dream about? For example, I dream of becoming a doctor. I dream about becoming a doctor.

Non-na­tive speak­ers of­ten get con­fused about what the var­i­ous tens­es and as­pects mean in English. With in­put from some of the folk here I've put to­geth­er a di­a­gram that I hope will pro­vide some clar­i­ty on the mat­ter.
I’m in­ter­ested in us­ing the word maven to de­scribe some­one as be­ing an ex­pert, but don’t want to seem con­de­scend­ing.
Con- derives from the Latin prefix con-, which was in turn derived from the Latin word cum "with". The prefix was assimilated to a following sound according to the following rules: Before vowels and h, the prefix becomes co-.
In a comment, Colin Fine wrote: Peo­ple who be­lieve that English is an in­fe­rior sort of Latin, so its gram­mar must ape Latin gram­mar, will tell you that it should be "she".
In one of the IELTS lis­ten­ing tests, there is a fill-out-the-blank ques­tion read­ing: The mu­seum is not open on ___.

Bête noire is technically a French phrase, but it's been adopted into the English language. https://www. merriam-webster.
A painting by Pablo Picasso can be referred to as a Picasso, but the plural would be Picassos: "Russians have money,” he went on.
This indicates that the word "tiding" is much rarer in written works than "tidings". Whilst this proves nothing, when you take into consideration that 'tiding' is also the collective noun for magpies and a form of the verb "tide", the use of 'tiding' as the singular form of 'tidings' is likely to be negligible.
In the sense of something that is annoying specifically to me, and not to others (like a pet peeve), I would use the words bugbear or bugaboo.
There are a couple of problems. Ways to express the idea of studying someone's art: "I studied the art of Pablo Picasso.

(NOTE: This post is for Buffalox8, but the same 'method' is used to parse it. ) From Yulia at Goodreads: He [I have no idea who Yulia is referring to] wrote: The trick here is that "buffalo" can be a noun, an adjective, and a verb.
Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo This wiki page asserts that the sentence comprised of n "buffalo" (for all n) is a valid sentence.
Both "buffalo" and "police" serve as enough different parts of speech to enable us to form entire sentences by simply repeating the word.
The subject of the sentence is the first Buffalo buffalo, which is a collective noun phrase. It's becoming much less clever sounding.
I'm going to stick my neck out and say that there's no grammatical rule that disbars OP's example. But it's appalling English, which can't possibly be endorsed.

Is something that is neuronal necessarily neural? Or does it depend on the context? E.g. Is it that something that is neuronal has to do with neurons, while something that is neural has to do with nerves or the nervous system?
A Unipedal organism has 1 leg A Bipedal organism has 2 legs A Quadrupedal organism has 4 legs A Hexapedal organism has 6 legs An Octopedal organism has 8 legs But what is a general term that combines anything with more than 4 legs into one word?
In British English, pants means underpants or, informally, nonsense. In American English, pants means trousers; the singular form is used as adjective.
Neural means "relating to a nerve" (Oxford), so is the difference that one is actually a nerve, and the other only relating to a nerve?

What does the noun "lucker" mean? It's not in the Webster, but Google does give search results for such key phrases as "I am a lucker" or "He is a lucker" (and those are not misspellings like "luckier" or "lurker").
What does the noun lucker mean? What does the noun "lucker" mean? Yes, it's not in the Webster, but Google does give search results for such key phrases as "I am a lucker" or "He is a lucker" (and those are not misspellings like "luckier" or "lurker").
Is this right? Isn't there any difference between clued-in and clued-up? For Instance, here's an example from Oxford: - "I'm not too clued-up on turtles' habits" Can I replace this with " I'm not too clued-in on turtles' habits" without any change or loss in meaning?
@Louis. " = We might think that God might do that too, but God knows better, and God, by his own grace, constrains himself, so God does not do that.
A biography of Winston Churchill is the story of Churchill's life. A biography about Winston Churchill implies to me that it's the story of someone's life, and the subject of the book is Churchill.

He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, he did not. Can I say “in the first two nights”, “during the first two nights” or “on the first two nights” instead of “for the first two nights” in the sentence above?
You should use bottommost and topmost. The postfix "most" shows physical position. Use the postfix "most" with adjectives that compare three or more things.
"noon" is the term for the middle of the day, round about 12. 00 to 13. 00, and "midnight" is from 24. 00 to 1. 00, at night.
By most definitions, the date changes at midnight. That is, at the precise stroke of 12:00:00. However, for convenience, most people lump the 12:00:00 time with its nearest neighbour, 12:00:01, which IS AM or PM.
If you look at most writing and scientific guides, there is no such thing as 12 a.m. or 12 p.m. It's technically neither.

Which of the following are "correct" ways to abbreviate Nota Bene? N.B. blahblah n.b. blahblah NB. blahblah nb. ) Authoritative sources would be much appreciated.
I think they're both grammatical, and mean the same thing. However, the reader has to be familiar with Hawaiian and English to understand the meaning, which makes the sentence moot.
You pronounce N.B. (also written as NB or n.b. , nb) as /ˌenˈbiː/. (MacMillan). See also Cambridge. In other words you say the names of the two letters, just like for e.g.
Though unusual, I wouldn't say the usage is deprecated: "smells and savors of the season", "which savors of politics", but surely there be an ill savor", . . . .............................
Both are correct and have the same meaning, but there is a subtle difference between these two sentences. In "Aloha" is "hello" in Hawaiian.

No. At least not in statistics. independent). Two random variables might be linearly independent and orthogonal, just as two variables might be linearly independent but not orthogonal.
Language changes. That's why we're not speaking Old English anymore. Perhaps the people using "to injunct" feel it's clearer and more natural than "to enjoin".

I would use the same word you did and call it "a forked figure" forked - shaped like a fork or having a forked part. Merriam-Webster examples: a forked road, a forked tail, a forked tongue, a forked tree, etc.
Are "strait laced" and "straight laced" synonymous? "Strait," as in Strait of Magellan, straitjacket or dire straits means narrow or confined while "straight" means exactly what one would think it to mean.

A good example of a question about auto-antonyms is: How did “strike” get its baseball meaning? In this question, the auto-antonym in question is strike, which in baseball can mean either hitting or missing the ball.
For phrases, I'm not sure I've heard one specifically. But for single words, like peruse, quite, cleave, I generally see the term contranym and auto-antonym.
Perhaps this is what you're searching for? My google search came up with this website first, and then this wikipedia article.
An auto-antonym is alternatively called an antagonym, Janus word (after the Roman god), enantiodrome, self-antonym, antilogy, or addad (Arabic, singular didd).
I think you're referring to Auto-antonyms. I guess, Janus word is also acceptable. There was a list on Wikipedia (List of Auto-antonyms in English), since moved to Wiktionary's Appendix of English contranyms.

I would use "Arabic" of the language and literature, and "Arab" otherwise. I wouldn't use "Arabian" except perhaps referring to the the country "Saudi Arabia" - but I would more likely say "Saudi".
fossils [that were] clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans were missing until recently.
Arabic pertains to the language. Arab is any person whose mother tongue is Arabic. "Arab" does not necessarily involve a relation to Arabia (the Arabian Peninsula).
Fossils ... were missing until recently. In other words, for a long time nobody had them, but now they do. "clearly intermediate" modifies "Fossils".

A glade is a treeless area in a forest. A "glade in the mist" would be a treeless area in a forest that is in the mist.
The difference is largely one of connotation. Because of this association, when you say that something is shrouded with or shrouded in, it connotes an atmosphere of mystery, gloom, or the numinous.
Not quite, apart from in the specific phrase “curiouser and curiouser”, taken from Alice in Wonderland. Lewis Carroll was playing with language there.
you can use misty water for that!! mist•y (ˈmɪs ti) adj. mist•i•er, mist•i•est. covered or obscured by mist. consisting of or resembling mist.

I believe the word you are looking here is: Improper From http://dictionary. reference. com/browse/improper —Synonyms 1–3.
I believe that the comparative and superlative for the word 'little' are: 'less' and 'least' respectively. If we want to compare inanimate things like dolls, can we say something like: "My barbie doll is the littlest of all my dolls" or " My barbie doll is the littler of the two dolls". ?
Bimbo means, "an attractive but empty-headed young woman, especially one perceived as a willing sex object. One of the meaning of doll is, "an attractive young woman, often with connotations of unintelligence and frivolity"; Barbie doll does have a similar meaning.
I remember I had a conversation where I have told a girl she was Barbie doll. I just meant she looked beautiful like a Barbie doll: blond, and with blue eyes.

The main difference is that 'abase' is something you do yourself (or other people do themselves, of their own volition), whereas 'abash' is something that you do to other people (or other people do to you).
When editing for a valedictory occasion, I came across this: "Prof. Li holds the XXX Professorship from 2007 to 2012. " It is the tense of "holds" that baffles me.
Well not exactly, but according to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, impregnable means: ADJECTIVE: 1.
I like imbue. http://dictionary. reference. to impregnate or inspire, as with feelings, opinions, etc. : The new political leader was imbued with the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.
Perhaps this is a weird question, but I couldn't find an answer via etymologies. When something is "impregnable" it means "cannot be broken into.

Here you can see asparagine and aspartic acid as example: Asparagine (Asn) Aspartic acid (Asp) Aspartic and glutamic acid include a carboxylic acid (-COOH), whereas asparagine and glutamine are carboxamides (-CO-NH2).
The same is true for amination. Exceptions do exist, of course. For example, Not all transaminations involve glutamate/glutamine (as this user has replied), and serine and threonine can be directly deaminated (via dehydratase enzymes, as opposed to the dehydrogenase used for glutamate).
Even the GABA aminotransferase employs glutamate/α-ketoglutarate. It seems that all transaminases use glutamate/α-ketoglutarate; in fact most of them do.

Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, "together", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, "sensation") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.

More often than not selection acts at the phenotypic level, and dominance refers to the phenotype. However, when we talk about genotypic fitness ($W$), without any information about the phenotype that each genotype produce, we disregard phenotypic quantity and look at phenotypic quality (fitness).
I have some fragments of DNA from single and double digests using three different restriction enzymes. The map needs indicate the relative positions of the restriction sites along with distances from the ends.

Sleep occurs in stages. If your alarm goes off while you are in the middle of deep sleep, you are going to feel different from if you had woken up naturally.
Sleep-walking is a mixture of NREM and wakefulness. Mahowald, M. W. ,  Schenck, C. H. (2005). Nature, 437(7063), 1279–85.
And how it is raised again during the latter stages of sleep? There is an arousal threshold during sleep that only when it is overcome will it wake a person up.
And these different stages may play different roles in 'rejuvenating' the body (as you put it). Interesting note: There are people who have tried a method called polyphasic sleep, where they nap/sleep periodically and regularly, instead of sleeping once a day for 8 hours, say.
Keep in mind that colder enviromental tempratures significantly attenuated METH-induced neurotoxicity Could the reason as to why 7-NI prevents METH induced neurotoxicity and dopamine depletion simply be because it oxidizes dopamine oxidizer peroxynitrite noting that non-meth induced hyperthermia also cause neurotoxicity and produces peroxynitrite while showing the same neurotoxicity markers as METH induced neurotoxicity such as nitrotyrosine?

While the heart is affected during septic shock, it is the result of the chain of events that occur as a result of a systemic release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) that leads to the "collapse of the circulatory and respiratory system.
They include, in the case of accidental necrosis, HMGB1, IL-1a, uric acid, DNA fragments, mitochondrial content, and ATP (Tables 1and2)(Eigenbrod et al.
This is quite a big question! The influx and efflux reach an equilibrium at the Nernst potential, where the electrical and chemical forces equal out.

In my own opinion, I would not classify this as parasitism, as more unpalatable species are eaten with Batesian mimicry (and eating causes death).
Keeping in mind that I know nothing about this, I will try to explain why the hand can be modelled with 27 degrees of freedom.
In Stathos and Fishman (2014), the authors refer to the concept of structural underdominance. The first time they mention it is in the first paragraph of the second page (left column) and the term is followed by some kind of definition in parenthesis.
In the vertical plane, bending of the fingers is indeed referred to as flexion, while straightening is called extension.
119). This can then lead to unbalanced gametes with low viability, which means low fitness compared to homozygotes. If I have understood the process correctly, chromosomal doubling should lead to better pairing of chromosomes and lower risk of unbalanced chromosome translocations.

Ventricular diastole is a period in cardiac cycle during which the ventricles are filling with blood. During this period, the atria are contracting and the ventricles are relaxed.
So, when we say that our blood pressure is 180mmhg, it's wrong. In reality, the blood pressure is (180+760)mmHg inside the blood vessel, and our blood pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure by 180mmhg.
I know it must be highest in the arteries. arteries>capillaries>veins Arteries: 120-80mmHg (systolic - diastolic). What are the typical systolic and diastolic blood pressure in arteries,capillaries, veins and the heart?
For further investigation into the progress of the blood pressure, we will measure a patient's blood pressure in the superior vena cava measured during inhalation and during an exhalation.
My study materials use the word vesselcompression chamber of aorta to emphasize aorta's elastic property. The arch of the aorta only coils, not its straight part.

When a human baby is born "en caul" (aka enclosed in the amniotic sac) the amnion detaches from the chorion and the baby comes out in the sac with the chorion still attached to the placenta.
Short answer Walnuts are classified both as nuts and drupes ('stone fruits'). background According to University of Wisconsin - Madison, Department of Botany , hickory and walnut can be classified both as drupes and nuts, but are best classified as nuts.
We've been learning about fruits (and the various categories thereof) in class; among them we have the nut and the drupe.

The mechanism given by the OP is renowned in the world of pharmacology and drug-receptor interactions, and is due to Castillo and Katz (1957).
I think the OP is asking the following: If an enzyme is not specific one substrate, but is simultaneously presented with a pair of substrates, which one 'wins' and how do we decide?
$ a_{ii} $ :are intra-species interference coefficient of the two prey species. $ K_{i}, i=1, 2 $ : the environmental carrying capacity for ith prey species.
Note: The term equilibrium is different from steady-state w.r. t chemical reactions. Steady state is the right term for the above example.
No. But a strong correlation may nevertheless be an indicator for heritability (it makes it more likely). The reason is, that the correlation in the phenotype (birth weight) is not only due a correlation in the genotype but also a correlation in the environment of the child and its mother (culture, economical situation, genes, etc of their respective mothers).

Pangolin scales are certainly not retained from fish. Pangolins are within the clade Pholidota (Tree of Life page for Eutheria) and their nearest relatives are anteaters, sloths, and armadillos.
I have seen about 3 variation of phylogenetic tree about odd-toed ungulate and I don't know which one is really updated or outdated or which one have more backed up theory First is odd-toed ungulate are closest to even-toed ungulate https://en.
So, I suspect things are actually somewhat complicated and the best way to know would be to test in vivo That would suggest that at concentrations significantly below 2.

No it isn't necessary to breathe in CO2 from the atmosphere. For the buffer system your brain detects the amount of CO2 (H+ which is an indicator of excess or too little CO2) and adjusts your breathing automatically to compensate so that your blood's pH stays normal.
The lac operon contains genes which are important for the metabolization of lactose as an energy source - normally glucose is used for this purpose.
Will after looking up more about IPTG online I see it's related to the lac operator, which from what I've found just deals with lactose.

I kindly ask to show me some pictures that is a generally accurate geologic time scale. In google, a lot of geo time scales are different.
A path of coefficient of relationship is defined as $$\rho_{AO} = \left( \frac{1}{2}\right)^n \sqrt { \frac{1+f_A}{1+f_O}}$$ This SE post discusses this definition From this, the coefficient of relatedness between two individuals $B$ and $C$ is defined as $$R_{BC} = \sum \rho_{AB} \rho_{AC}$$ , where $A$ is (I think) the last common ancestor of $B$ and $C$.

They can't see all the birds that are around them as some are hidden behind the others. However, I don't think there is anything so extraordinary; they watch around, have good reflexes and can change direction very abruptly.
The reason of the disease is an autosomal dominant mutation on the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, an enzyme that converts porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane by a deamination reaction.

The Atkins diet is based on that. Without carb intake, however, the citric acid cycle (CAC) eventually basically stops and proteins will be utilized to be converted to carb intermediates to feed the CAC.
- PUFAs replace trans fats and saturated fats in certain types of foods. I am thinking reasons for it. Saturated fatty acids have more energy than unsaturated.
The answers to most of your questions are under active research and there are many unknowns. Understanding this process is one of the main goals of developmental biology.

I would do this through the Reactome database. Searching for "AKT Signalling" returns, among other things, an entry for PI3K/AKT Signaling in Cancer (Homo sapiens) (REACT_147723).
I would like to make a double PCR with universal tailed primer. The first PCR would make a tailed amplicon. The second PCR would generate fragment labeled with fluorescent dye.
I am trying to build a NGS library on enriched DNA (DNA length = 93 bp). I am using PCR amplification with two overhanging primers, both containing Illumina adapter sequences (Universal Adapter  TruSeq Adapter w/ barcode).
The reason maternal non-disjunction during meiosis II can produce XXY offspring. In this case, meiosis I occurs as normal so that after the first division the replicated homologous chromosomes, each consisting of two chromatids connected at a centromere, have separated.
So during the S-phase , the meiocyte would contain 46 chromosomes. So 46×4 strands of DNA is present. Often each helix / duplex is considered one DNA molecule , so in that case you have 46×2 molecules.

Gergana is right about the effects of the Guanidine isothiocyanate, but not the details there of. Guanidine isothiocyanate absorbs strongly at 260 and NOT 230 (guanidine hcl is the one that absorbs strongly at 230).
The 260/230 ratio gives you idea about the contaminants in your sample. Guanidine isothiocyanate, which is usually used for RNA isolation, absorbs at 230nm, so that might be what you see.

One may think that Argon, being an inert noble gas, causes no harm at all and can perfectly replace N2 in a mix with oxygen.
Nature Methods seems to publish quite a few methods that facilitate this kind of analysis. E.g. http://www. nature. com/nmeth/journal/v8/n3/full/nmeth.
Can humans breathe an Argon-Oxygen atmosphere, where Argon substitutes the inert Nitrogen gas which currently populates our atmosphere?
I think that the OP was asking about relevance of using urea with respect to the FASP method. In the FASP method, the primary denaturant is SDS .

What triggered this change? Did it happen by chance or does the bacterium have some sort of response mechanism to cause this change on detecting penicillin?
We suggest describing their differences as alleles by using previously used numbers, e.g. et al. Biosens Bioelectron. 2013 Nov 15;49:334-40.
I think the main reason is the natural selection that is causing methicillin-resistance. However, I am not completely sure what this means practically.
There are three mechanisms: prevention of the interaction between antibiotic and the target PBP; modification of the binding of the antibiotic to the PBP; hydrolysis of the antibiotic by a beta-lactamase.

Why is the mitochondrial step necessary? I'm looking at the gluconeogenic pathway: Pyruvate is shuttled into the mitochondria from the cytosol, converted to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase, converted to malate which is then shuttled out of the mitochondria, and then converted back to oxaloacetate in the cytosol.
What does this have to do with gluconeogenesis? If we have these two pathways, what is the point of using aspartate? Thus, OAA is converted directly to PEP in the mitochondria by mitochondrial PEPCK and shuttled out to the cytosol to begin gluconeogenesis.
To be more detailed it is the irreversibly of the reaction carried by Pyruvate dehydrogenase that makes the conversion of the fatty acid chains to glucose impossible.
If I understand it correctly the pathway goes: Acetyl-CoA --> Propionate --> Proprionyl-CoA --> ... --> 3-HP Not exactly.
The reactions do not balance. Therefore, an anaplerotic substrate like glutamine or asparate is needed to replenish the lost oxaloacetate.

Your first question seems to be terminological. (And hence, in this sense, is more "robust" than other rules. But this is just a definition, and anyone is free to modify it as they see fit for their own purposes, as long as they are clear and consistent in their use of terminology.
The hairdresser has bought scissors, shampoo, etc. He may even heat his/her store and supply it with electricity. These are all input to the production on which VAT was paid.
E.g. Therefore these are separate properties. You can argue you need both, but perhaps you are willing to part with one or the other.
First it is important to define our terms. When you ask, "does a disagreement regarding how to weight the voters entail a disagreement regarding aggregation rule?

If the utility is continuous and locally insatiable then the Hicksian demand equals the Walrasian demand. So you'll need to look for a utility function which violates atleast one of these.

Yes, there are many. For each $a  0$, we have $(a+1, a) \succ (a, a)$, and therefore, $u(a+1, a)  u(a, a)$. Since $a \in \mathbb{R_{++}}$, there are uncountably many such intervals, but set of rational numbers are countable.
Setting: We have two choices of goods $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ from the set of choices $[-1,1]^2$. Sadly, these are the two main theorems/propositions that I've learned to solve these problems.
You just need to use the violation of transitivity and proceed by contradiction. (another two reals). Since the reals are transitive, we conclude $u(x_1,y_1)\geq u(x_3,y_3)$ which in turn implies that $(x_1,y_1)R(x_3,y_3)$.
Utility functions and indifference curves are the same object considered from different visual/conceptual angles. Below an illustration on $U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{0.

Kaplan and Menzio's shopping time model is a searchmatching unemployment model where we, for a steady state equilibrium, need to determine to variables: $J$: Value of a worker $u$: unemployment rate Their steady state values ($\dot J, \dot u = 0$) are given by the following system of equations: $$ J = \frac{(1-\gamma)(S(u) + y_e - y_u)}{\rho + \delta}\\ u = \frac{\delta}{\delta + \lambda(J)} $$ Furthermore, "profits from the good with price dispersion" and wages, respectively, are given by (equations (6), (7) on page 12) $$ S(u) = A(u) + B(u)*w(u)\\ w(u) = y_u + \gamma*(S(u) + y_e - y_u) $$ Where $A(u), B(u)$ are some placeholders for a bunch of constants and parameters, that may depend on $u$.

As far as i understand in the Krugman target zone model the following equation describes the behaviour of the exchange rate within and outside a target zone $s_t = f_t + \alpha E_t(ds_t/dt)$.
I think your questions are very interesting. We also avoid costs associated with accelerated climate change. Our options for helping those farmers or manufacturers out of work include but are not limited to: incentives to switch to crop farming start-up programs to encourage new land use such as afforestation or sanctuaries incentives for transport, retail, accommodation, or local government to provide training or apprenticeship schemes for those out of work.
Time series on rental price of capital can be estimated using $$r=\frac{P_k}{P}(i-inf+\delta)$$ here, $P_k$ is the price of capital goods (price index for capital goods), $P$ is a deflator, $i$ is nominal interest rate, $inf$ is an inflation rate and $\delta$ is depreciation rate of physical capital stock.
in preparation for our upcoming exam, our tutor has uploaded sample questions. One of them is the following: This is my solution: Which differs from the solution, which gives the ordinary square root of the same parameters, not the 4th-one.
As mentioned by Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green, the equality is true "for all $p$ and $w$". This implies the former equality and also explains why it is not only true for the upscaled new prices and income $(p,w)=(\kappa p_0,\kappa w_0)$ but actually for any prices and income because both $\kappa$ and $(p_0,w_0)$ can be arbitrary.

3) Just as a curiosity, what it is the reason of including the adjective "correlated"? From reading at p. 2) How does the definition of BCE simplify to when $N=1$?
7 of this paper. Let me summarise the definition provided in the paper. There are $N\in \mathbb{N}$ players, with $i$ denoting a generic player.
I would like your help to use the correct terminology to define a Bayes Correlated Equilibrium (BCE) and a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) in a "game" with one player.
Question 1: Is it correct to say that $S^*$ is at least as informative as $S^1$? Is it correct to say that: $\forall S \in \mathcal{S}$ where $S\equiv ((T_i)_{i=1}^N, \pi)$, there exists a combination $S^*\in \mathcal{S}$ of $\underline{S}$ and $S$ such that $S^*$ and $S$ are informationally equivalent.

And on p. " Also, I'm somewhat unsurprised that Stiglitz turns out to be an editor of this journal. 23 What remains unclear is whether the Eurozone authorities are willing and legally entitled to impose EU-related rather than Eurozone-specific hardships on an exiting country.
Unsustainable is a strong word for describing state budgets. For all NJ short comings, they have a massive tax base that actually pays taxes, a responsible and effective legal system, the US FED, non-corrupt politicians (but not effective), New York City, and industry.
Presidential candidate Andrew Yang has published the following policy proposals on his website: 1. The best answers should include an explication of financial transaction tax, examples of what tangible changes the second policy proposal might entail, and an analysis of how impactful all of this could and is likely to be for algorithmic intraday trading.
europa. By the way, by my research, in 2017 the Japanese debt-to-GDP was more like 253%. So stay tuned friend as evidence is accumulating that developed economies such as Japan and in particular, the United States, are on dangerous ground and possibly past the point of no return.
The EU has a harmonized CPI methodology (HICP). ] Methods used for combining prices to give elementary aggregates vary widely among the individual countries of the G-20, the geometric mean (Jevons index) is the method most commonly used (10 countries plus France, Italy and the United Kingdom).

So can i use propensity score matching to evaluate this program? Thank you everyone:) So i want to make a research about the impact of this program to community empowerment and infrastructure in villages.
I screenshot the picture beneath from HSBC HK's website. Scroll down a quarter of the way, and click on 'Rates' to download that PDF.
I would begin my search by finding related papers in the Journal of Applied Econometrics that contains currency as a key word.
In recent coverage of the Fed's repo operation, I was struck by this line: It also indicated Wall Street is struggling to absorb record sales of Treasury debt to fund a swelling U.S.

It seems that Warnock-Smith is basing his remark on the official Airports Commission forecasts (made in 2014). 38-48), so I'm not going to reproduce them here.
I think it will help to fill in some of the missing causal elements in this picture. Therefore this is a sign that the economy will not do well in the future.
Both answers here are giving really good definitions of the concepts, but I think it's important to additionally talk about the relation between the two to clarify the justified confusion and to compare them.
About your second paragraph, the confusion arises from the benchmark that you want to compare. So if you compare the spot rates before and after raising the interest rate, you find that the domestic currency appreciate.

It seems that you have firm-level panel data over multiple industries in multiple countries. Year fixed effects control for trends.
Wikipedia says: 'Fermi's golden rule describes a system which begins in an eigenstate, ${\displaystyle |i\rangle } |i\rangle$ , of an unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H_0$ and considers the effect of a perturbing Hamiltonian, $H'$ applied to the system.
If you used these to derive your IOT, then you can use those to build your SAM, though note you need both the Supply AND Use tables for this.
The surviving probability at period 2 is p. The interest rate is fixed at r. Under what condition she prefers the economy with the PAYG pension?

Let me begin with noting that models such as the CAPM have been extensively falsified, beginning with Mandelbrot in 1963 and ending with the Fama-MacBeth testing in 1973.
So, for example, when you have performed a t-test, you have assumed that a mean exists and that it is meaningful. Non-parametric methods allow you to perform tests on data without reference to a parameter.
In The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, Gary Becker said: The combined assumptions of maximizing behavior, market equilibrium, and stable preferences, used relentlessly and unflinchingly, form the heart of the economic approach as I see it.
Problem: According to Wulf Gaertner’s (2009, p. ” This makes sense, however, when I looked up the definition of a `strictly increasing function/transformation’ I became confused regarding how this would allow one to represent cases of indifference as well as cases of strict preference.
The first has to do with what happens in reality, and it implies that the marginal relation is constant. The second may be obtained even if the actual relation is not linear, but non-linear in specific ways that permit to obtain it by a suitable transformation of the data.

Some confusion and misleading statements in the answers given. A maximization problem is ill-posed if it does not have a solution.
I assume from this that the $x_i$ are constrained to be non-negative? Using the Lagrange multiplier technique with Lagrangian $L=\sum_i f(x_i)-\lambda (\sum_i x_i-\overline x)$, we can conclude that the stationary points occur when $\frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x}\big{|}_{x_i}=\lambda$.
For simplicity, I've assumed U = 9 in this case but the solution would work for any U > 0. Px/Py  1/3. e, Px/Py > 1/3. x can vary anywhere from 0 to U.
Find the returns to scale for he following production function- $(x_1 + 1)^. The answer given, however, is decreasing returns to scale.
My notes says that if $u(. )$ is strictly quasiconcave and differentiable, by the supporting hyperplane theorem, there exists $p 0$ and $w \geq 0$ such that $ x = x(p,w)$ $\forall x$.

I am testing for cointegration between the Real GDP per capita of England and France. (My residuals were non-stationary).
I am conducting some regressions on economic growth determinants and I am disillusioned. What does this tell about whether the explanatory variables influence economic growth?
One way to think about this utility function is "I can only use one of these two goods, and I will use the one that I have more of" Some examples: Choosing between two sets of equally-valued but non-matching dishware.
Blundell and Costa Dias (2000) (https://onlinelibrary. wiley. com/doi/pdf/10. 1111/j. 1475-5890. 2000. tb00031. x) present in page 448 a generic matching estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated as: $\hat{\tau}^{ATT} = \sum_{i:T_i = 1} \Big( Y_i - \sum_{j: T_j = 0} W_{i,j} \cdot Y_j \Big) \cdot w_i$ where, and I quote, "$W_{i,j}$ is the weight placed on comparison observation j for individual i and i $w_i$ accounts for the reweighting that reconstructs the outcome distribution for the treated sample".

No, it was moved to chat because Stack Exchange is getting tired of this nonsense and asked me to "please avoid extended discussions in comments".
It will vary in value because trust in it will fluctuate just as trust in facebook fluctuates. There will also be volatility as trust varies in confidence in the payment system; its integrity and security; how exchangeable it is; its exposure to fraud, to tax, to money-laundering investigations For holders, there is also significant counter-party risk in whether Facebook chooses to honour their holding.
Recently, I read a news article stating Indiabulls Housing Finance shares plunges on reports of litigation against company Why do shares plunge when company finds itself in a litigation process?
From a) we obtain $y - \hat{y}_x = M_xy = M_xu$ and from b) $y - \hat{y}_z = M_zy = M_zX\beta + M_zu$, where $M_x$ and $M_z$ are the residual-maker matrices (the ones from the accepted answer of the question that you linked) and $\hat{y}_x$ and $\hat{y}_z$ are the predicted values of y based on the who linear models.

But in reality, consumption is often done not by an individual but by an household/family. All household members live in the same house, use the same furniture and the same electricity equipment, etc.
There is another counter for sugar, where I can buy one unit of sugar for a price of $p_2$. My preferences are such that I always want 1 unit of sugar with 1 unit of coffee; if I consume units of coffee and sugar in the ratio $1:1$, additional units of only one of the two don't give me extra utility.
Alex consumes only lemons and sugar. For each lemon he requires exactly 2 spoons of sugar. What is Alex's optimal consumption bundle?

I have just read the concept of both Net Present Worth (NPW) and the External Rate of Return (ERR). I may have understood wrong, please correct me if I am wrong.
Let $c = 0$ and $Q_k = \sum_{i = 1}^k{q_i}$. For $j = n$ the best response is given by \begin{align} b_n(Q_{n-1}) = \arg\max_{q_n}(1 - Q_{n-1} - q_n)q_n = \frac{1- Q_{n-1}}{2}.
Note first that for each nontrivial (more than one point) compact interval $I$, there exists a strictly increasing function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $I$.
I was carefully rereading the underlying paper (Bloch, 1996) and found what I was looking for. Let $N = \{1,\ldots,n\}$ denote the set of agents and let $\Pi_{\{1, \ldots, i-1\}}$ denote the set of coalition structures of $\{1, \ldots, i-1\}$ for all $i \in \{2,\ldots,n\}$.

I'm wondering how to interpret Okun’s coefficient. Say you have $y^c = -1*u^c$. The “-2” regime therefore looks more contractionary.
What I'm reading seems to suggest that the price of the subsidiary's stock will converge to that of its parent, but I'm not sure why.
If you multiply out any one of the equations, $$w_{clothes}= \beta _ {clothes} + \alpha_{clothes} \cdot \ kids + (\gamma _{0.
I have the following demand equation system (expenditure ratio model): $w_{clothes}= \beta _ {clothes} + \alpha_{clothes} * \ kids + (\gamma _{0.
I can provide you with a sketch of proof to proceed. The quantity $\sqrt{n}(\bar{x}-\mathrm{E}(X)) \overset{d}{\to} N(0,\,\mathrm{V}(X))$ by Central Limit Theorem.

I would like to discuss with you about the following production function. Thanks a lot. Or how can I interpret them in economic aspect?
Though behavioural economics has been popularized over the past decade in both industry and pop culture, it seems that not much has changed with regard to the standard economic definition of rationality.
Here's another way, using the same notation as Adam, to get to the same result: $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = P(\text{searching twice | being matched})\cdot P(\text{another match | searching twice}) $$ Now, $$P(\text{searching twice | being matched}) = \frac{P(\text{searching twice and being matched})}{P(\text{being matched})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s} $$ $$P(\text{another match | searching twice}) = \frac{P(\text{another match and searching twice})}{P(\text{searching twice})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} $$ So, $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s}\frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} = \frac{2\psi_u\nu}{(1+\psi_u)}$$

Let $P_{V}\in \Delta(\mathcal{V})$ be the probability distribution of $V$. Nature draws a realisation, $v$, of $V$ from $P_{V}$.
Consider the following single-agent choice problem under uncertainty. Let $V$ be the state of the world with support $\mathcal{V}$ and probability distribution $P_V\in \Delta(\mathcal{v})$.
You have specialized the definition of BCE in two dimensions: there is only one player, and the player has no private information.

In the case of Apple at least, the answer is yes: this article dated August 31 2019 talks about the impact of the latest round of tariffs on Apple products produced in China.
Through a quick research I have found that VEC, VAR, SVAR models are the most common. Are they though good forecasters?
If it's just knowing about the models, I'd suggest starting with Hamilton's "Time Series Analysis" but any book like it will do.
We also commonly use measures like means squared error, mean absolute percentage error, Theil's U, etc. etc. You then compare your forecast predictions to known data and to those of other forecasts.

$\newcommand{\vect}[1]{{\bf #1}}$ Note that you can write the system in the form $$ \dot{\vect{x}} = A \vect{x} + \vect{b} $$ where $$ \vect{x} = \left(\begin{array}{c} x \\ y\end{array}\right), ~~~~ A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1  1 \\ 2  -1\end{array}\right), ~~~~~ \vect{b} = \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 5\end{array}\right) $$ A fixed point $\vect{x}^*$ is a point for which $A\vect{x}^* + \vect{b} = 0$, which in this case is $$ \vect{x}^* = \left(\begin{array}{c} -2 \\ 1\end{array}\right) $$ Now define the variable $$ \vect{z} = \vect{x} - \vect{x}^* $$ and note that $$ \dot{\vect{z}} = \dot{\vect{x}} = A\vect{x} + \vect{b} = A\vect{x} - A\vect{x}^* = A(\vect{x} - \vect{x}^*) = A\vect{z} $$ That is, $$ \dot{\vect{z}} = A \vect{z} $$ What you need to do now is to find the eigen-decomposition of $A$
I have a question about a derivation in Abraham (1987)'s simple job market matching model (equations 3 through 7): She begins by writing down tautologies: J - V = L - U = E where J is the number of jobs, V is the number of vacancies, L is the total labor force, U is the total unemployed, and E is the total employed.
Note that function $p$ actually depends upon a single variable $u/v$ and I prefer avoiding the abuse of notation (source of confusion) and write $p(u/v) = P(u,v)$.
$ \textbf{Answer:} $ Simply put, it does not matter which good goes on which axis as long as the relationship between the two goods is adjusted for correctly.
Let $X = h(Y)$. A first-order Taylor expansion around $E(Y) = \mu_y$ gives $$X \approx h[\mu_y] + h'[\mu_y]\cdot [Y-\mu_y]$$ This easily leads to $$\sigma^2_x \approx \big(h'[\mu_y]\big)^2\cdot \sigma^2_y$$ Since $$\eta_{x,y} \equiv h'\cdot \frac Yh \implies \eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) = h'(\mu_y)\frac {\mu_y}{h(\mu_y)} \implies h'(\mu_y) = \eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) \cdot \frac {h(\mu_y)}{\mu_y}$$ Substituting, $$\sigma^2_x \approx \left(\eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) \cdot \frac {h(\mu_y)}{\mu_y}\right)^2\cdot \sigma^2_y$$ Taking the square root we are led to $$\frac {\sigma_x}{h(\mu_y)} \approx \eta_{x,y}(\mu_y) \cdot \frac {\sigma_y}{\mu_y} $$ The difference of the above from the expression in the question is that a) The elasticity must be evaluated at the center of the Taylor expansion used and b) $h(\mu_y)$ is usually equal to $E(X)=E[h(Y)]=\mu_x$ only to a first approximation, due to Jensen's inequality.

If OA is a part of FA. The second equation follows from the first: $CA + KA = FA \wedge OA \neq 0 \Rightarrow FA - OA = CA +KA -OA \neq CA +KA$.
The basic principle of BOP accounting is double entry bookkeeping. In short, every transaction enters twice. As a consequence of this, by definition $$\text{Current account } (CA) + \text{Capital account } (KA) = \text{Financial account } (FA)$$ Note that this may differ depending on how you classify BOP accounts.
Let me rephrase the question in my own words: in an environment where automation increasingly is taking over, are there alternatives besides leaving the have-nots behind or providing a basic income?
I can safely assume that the market is efficient in the sense that two-week-old prices don't help to predict the price of the current week.
The negation would be "there does not exist at least one person that is better off, or, there exists someone that is worse off.

Bike sharing seems to have originated in China. And it has spread to the UK. And at least a decade on it continues to spread into the provinces.
The problem starts at time t0. Rewards decrease after each time step, at the same rate, and Rw > Rl always. For example at t0 Rw = 100, Rl = 50, p = 0.
It simply depends on the shape of the marginal external damages. If the total damages are linear in output, then the marginal damages are constant, and the gradient of the marginal social cost is the same as that of the marginal private cost.
I agree with Dan it is likely a typo. Some definitions (using your notations) Investment : $f_0$ Investment one year later : $f_1$ Net income : $f_1 - f_0$ ROI: $-1 + \frac{f_1}{f_0}$ It follows that the correct code should be ROI = (goog/goog.

I've been reading up on the von-Neumann and Savage proofs for the existence of an expected utility representation. Clearly this violates Allais' paradox.
Two players simultaneously announce a prime number less than 20. Denoting $p_{i}$ the number announced by the player $i$, the payoffs are: -If $p_{1}+p_{2}14$ each player receives as payment the value of $p_{i}+1$.
Using the data in the wikipedia link provided by @denesp we have the following picture, based on (2014 I think) Public Spending as percentage of GDP.

] The figures revealed that Denmark’s richest 10 percent now own as much as 70 percent of the rest of the population put together – a clear indication the government didn’t need to consider any more reforms aimed at benefiting the wealthiest Danes.
808 was the third-highest in the world. As of the year 2000, Denmark's income Gini coefficient of 0. (After-transfer) income inequality and wealth inequality are obviously not the same thing, but I would intuitively expect that, all else equal, they would be reasonably well correlated across countries.
Compare the Gini coefficients of {2,2,2,2,2,6,10,10,10,10,10} and of {1,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,26}: the former will have a Gini index of about 0.
I believe the following is the multiplicative property of bilinearity: $$ Y=F(K,AL) $$ $$ c_1 F(K,AL) = F(c_1 K, AL) $$ $$ c_2 F(K,AL) = F(K, c_2 AL) $$ But when we have multiplied through the production function with a constant we have done so through each term as below $$ c_3 F(K,AL) = F(c_3 K, c_3 AL) $$ e.g.
households from 1990 to 2016. This is an increase since 1990 of 0. Source: Statista In case you are interested in how data for such indeces are gathered, a recent study explaining its data process is Wealth Inequality in the United States since 1913.

$AVCAR$ means, without considering fixed cost, the firm is making a profit of $AR-AVC0$ per unit of output. Compare the two options: keep producing vs shutdown: Keep producing: $\text{Avg Profit}=\underbrace{AR-AVC}_{0}-AFC$ Shutdown: $\text{Avg Profit}=0-AFC$ Since $AVCAR$, staying in production is better since the revenues can be used to offset part of the fixed costs already incurred.
I'm trying to find some figures, however I cannot come up with a correct formulation, or lack of information in this field.
Well, I got basically a question about economics of our world, I hope I'm wrong in my assumptions, because it's pretty ugly and I'm really hope it's more about me being wrong than it's actually the truth.

Please do correct me if I am wrong). Thanks for any help :) (For if there is full-comparability between all individuals’ absolute-scale-measured utility functions, then their rank orders of alternatives are comparable, so surely a functional such as maximin can be used.

I don't think the edgeworth box will help here since there is only 1 good in the economy that is exchangeable. According to 1's utility function, he would always want to allocate his entire endowment of time to leisure.
In social choice theory, Arrow's impossibility theorem, the general possibility theorem or Arrow's paradox is an impossibility theorem stating that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) So, I'm looking for an example where the preferences satisfy unrestricted domain, non dictatorship, IIA and is an ordering, but not meet the Pareto criteria.
What does "SEN" / "sen" (possibly an abbreviation? ) mean in a shareholders' context? In particular, I am wondering how to interpret "sen" in the following context: "Earnings Per Share (sen)" This can be encountered a lot, as a simple google query "Earnings Per Share (sen)" shows.

This question comes out of Hansen's Econometrics ((https://www. ssc. wisc. edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics. pdf)) In section 2.
Let $\Vert A \Vert$ denote the spectral norm of a random matrix. Let $x$ and $u_k$ be N$\times$T matrices. Denote $\beta \cdot u = \sum_{k=1}^K\beta_ku_k $, where $\beta$ is a K-vector and $\beta_k$ a scalar.
If the function $ f(x,y) = (x-\alpha)^\beta \cdot y^{1-\beta} $ is homogeneous of degree $ k $, then it must be true that $ f(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^k \cdot f(x,y) $ for $ \lambda \in \mathbb{R} $ and some constant $ k $.
The asymptotic sampling distribution, after taking plim, of the OLS estimator is given by $\sqrt{N}(\hat{\beta}-\beta) = E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} \left(1/\sqrt{N} \sum_{I=1}^NX_ie_i \right) $ It must be shown that the asymptotic variance can be written as: $ Var[E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} 1/\sqrt{N} \sum_{I=1}^NX_ie_i] = \left( E[X_iX_i^T]^{-1} \right) \left( E[X_iX_i^T e_i^2]\right) \left( E[X_i X_i^T]^{-1} \right) $ Because the variance is linear in parameters, my idea was to start like this: $V[\sqrt{N}(\hat{\beta}-\beta)] = \sqrt{N}Var[\hat{\beta}] + 0$ Because the $Var[\beta]=0$.
Edit: My previous answer contained a mistake for the case where $x$ is restricted to $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$. Moreover, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds strictly unless $y - \delta$ is a multiple of $p$.

Basically the Lucas solution to SMD was the representative agent (which brought its own problems). 248).

Why have M3 not followed the same quantitive expansion as M1? Because commercial banks have used injected liquidities to "consolidate" their balance sheet instead of credit-stimulating demands.

Define the CES function $q : \mathbb R_+^n \to [0,1]$ by \begin{align} q(x) = \left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n{x_j^\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\right]^\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1} \end{align} where $x \in \mathbb R_+^n$ denote differentiated inputs, $\sigma \in \mathbb R_{++} \setminus \{1\} $ the constant elasticty of substitution among inputs and $q(x)$ a homogeneous output.
Let's look at the cournot model of competition. There are $n$ firms, each with idiosyncratic marginal cost $c_i$. Each firm simultaneously chooses its output (supply) quantity, $q_i$.
The first term on the RHS of the Slutsky equation (as you write it) should be $\frac{\partial h_i(p_i,p_j,I)}{\partial p_j}$, not $\frac{\partial h_i(p_i,p_j,I)}{\partial p_i}$.
Didn't manage to get to a definitve answer in one shot, but it seems to me that Jensen inequality is not going to help much.
I'm answering if there is any production function which is homogeneous and CES too. How about a CES production function only.

In the article where I found equation 1 (Chan and Chang, 2014), they have delineted the parameters as so: $R_{t+}= \max [0, R_t]$, $R_{t–} = \min [0, R_t]$, and $R_t$ is the monthly return of stock, bond, or real estate.
I don’t really see the connection you are drawing. As @Fizz has pointed out, immigration usually happens over time and maybe when immigrants grow old there will be more immigrants to support all of the new old.
For a project in experimental economics, I thought of doing something related to expected utility theory/prospect theory, but using grades instead of money.
This is called the Alchian–Allen effect. Another example is that Australians drink higher-quality Californian wine than Californians, and vice versa, because it is only worth the transportation costs for the most expensive wine.

That would increase unemployment. Another factor in employment is in the skills possessed and required for jobs. If these people lose their current jobs it may be difficult to find a job that they meet the requirements for.
You might be confusing comparative advantage with absolute advantage. Person C on the other hand, only gives up foraging 1 rabbit to cook 1 pot of rice per hour...
I am a bit confused regarding the actual definition of structural unemployment. Some places say that it is the permanent decline of a particular industry, leading to workers being unemployed as they are occupationally immobile.
Please imagine that Nicole is uncertain of her future wealth. Given a fixed $x_N$ , I need to derive $t_N(x_N)$and the implicit expression of $t_A(x_A)$ for a fixed $x_A$.
Well it seems like you are observing somthing consistent with Okun's Law which reveals empirically negative relationship between Unemployment and GDP.

I've started reading Jordi Galí's Monetary Policy, Inflation and the Business Cycle (2nd ed. , 2015). In section 2.5. 2, Galí considers an example with the following non-separable period utility function: $$U(X_t, N_t) = \frac{X_t^{1 - \sigma} - 1}{1 - \sigma} - \frac{N_t^{1 + \varphi}}{1 + \varphi}$$ where $X_t$ is defined as $$X_t = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \left[ (1 - \vartheta) C_t^{1 - \nu} + \vartheta \left( \frac{M_t}{P_t} \right)^{1 - \nu} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \nu}}  \nu \ne 1 \\ \displaystyle C_t^{1 - \vartheta} \left( \frac{M_t}{P_t} \right)^\vartheta  \nu = 1\end{cases}$$ Galí notes on p.
In the solution to the problem below provided by my professor he applies a first order condition to the lagrangian for ct, getting pt for the partial derivative of the argument "$\frac{d}{dc_t(t)} \int p_t(w)*c_t(w)dw$".
I am supposed to solve the problem: A 24-year-old man decides to invest 200,000 euros at a 7% annual interest rate to bring him a regular annual pension from 31 to 50 years inclusive.
$$\require{cancel}$$ Notice that if $\dot x_t \neq 0$, then $\Delta \dot x_t \to 0 \implies \Delta \to 0$ $$ \lim_{\Delta\to 0} \frac{f(x_{t+\Delta}) - f(x_t)}{\Delta} = \cancelto{f'(x_t)}{\lim_{\Delta \dot x\to 0} \frac{f(x_t + \Delta \dot x_t) - f(x_t)}{\Delta \dot x_t} \dot x_t}= f'(x_t)\dot x_t$$ If $\dot x_t = 0$, then $f(x_t)$ is a constant function.
To solve the problem you also need the equation: $Y_t=\left(\int_0^1 Y_t(j)^{1-\nu} \ dj \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\nu}}$ Now, the FOC is the same for every $Y_t(j)$, so we only have to differentiate once.

OLS The OLS part is clear: $\sum_{i=1}^n y_{2i} (y_{1i} - \hat\gamma_{12} y_{2i} - \hat\beta_{11} x_{1i}) = 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n x_{1i} (y_{1i} - \hat\gamma_{12} y_{2i} - \hat\beta_{11} x_{1i}) = 0$, where $\hat\gamma_{12}$ and $\hat\beta_{11}$ are the OLS estimators.
$\boldsymbol X^*_1$ is the residual of the projection of $\boldsymbol X_1 $ on $\boldsymbol X_2 $. The 'residual maker' matrix is $\boldsymbol I - \boldsymbol X_2 \left(\boldsymbol X_2^T\boldsymbol X_2\right)^{-1}\boldsymbol X_2^T$.
The result is not the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell Theorem. Rather, the result shows the extent of Omitted variable bias. The Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem states that the residuals of the regression of $\boldsymbol y$ on $\boldsymbol Z$, regressed on the residuals of the regression of $\boldsymbol X$ on $\boldsymbol Z$, gives $\boldsymbol{{\hat\beta}}$.
Recall that the total differential $df$ of a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n) \mapsto f(x)$, is defined as $$df = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x_i } dx_i = \sum_{i = 1}^n f_{x_i} dx_i = \nabla f \cdot \left(dx_1, \dots, dx_n\right)^\top$$ Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be variables, and let $a$, $b$, $c$, $k$ and $n$ be constants.

It doesn't look like there's an established term. Combine "demographic decline", "population decline" or even "fertility decline" (although this doesn't imply population decline) with whatever you are interested in (markets, economic growth etc.

I am interested in conducting research into how climate change impacts the social welfare of a country, particularly how it affects producers of agricultural product.
I'd like to know why economists thought Bretton Woods was a good idea. I've been reading about the history of the IMF recently, and it strikes me as odd that despite the problems that arose with the gold standard (Germany in the 1920s, Fed cutting money supply during the Depression), countries would agree to effectively peg their currencies to gold (via the US dollar).
But how did both FDR and Nixon both play two different roles? I do understand that after Nixon, value of dollar is not linked to amount of gold (No longer fixed exchange rate between gold and dollar).

Ms. I'm clueless about (b) and (c). So, my initial plan fails. A my attempt: a) for A: $C_2^A=(Y_1^A-C_1^A)(1+r) + Y_2^A$ for borrow this becomes: $C_2^A=(C_1^A-25,000)(1+200/100)+15,000$ or, $ C_2^A=3C_1^A-60000$ for lend this becomes: $C_2^A=(25,000-C_1^A)(1+0/100)+15,000$ or, $C_2^A=40,000-C_1^A$ my idea was to supersede one over the other and draw the kinked budget line but the borrow budget line in this case is totally below the x-axis and similarly for Mr.B.
It is largely a political rather than economic matter. Even in the US, there is now more traction for the idea. Like carbon taxes, congestion pricing is supported by most economists, but not by most of the public.
If $Y=f(AL,K)$ is CRS, $a_k+a_L=1$ by the Euler Theorem. However, I wanted to know the return to scale of $y=f(1,k)$ (i.e.

Take the following two-stage game with incomplete information and simultaneous actions in each state. As equilibrium concept I use subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.
The best way is taking the index "ingredients" and rebuild it... assuming you manage the index data on a DB or on an excel file, that should not be too difficult Otherwise, assuming you're index ingredients are averaged equally, then in a sense, the index is calculated as: Index = (1 + Product1ChangeIn%)^(1/9) * (1 + Product2ChangeIn%)^(1/9) ...
Payoffs are $u_i(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ for $i = 1,2$. As equilibrium concept I use subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. I find it by backward induction: (A) find the functions $a^*_3(\cdot)$ and $a^*_4(\cdot)$ such that $\forall (a_1,a_2)\in A_1\times A_2$ $$ \begin{cases} a_3^*(a_1, a_2)\in argmax_{a_3(\cdot)}u_1(a_1, a_2, a_3(a_1, a_2), a_4(a_1, a_2))\\ a_4^*(a_1, a_2)\in argmax_{a_4(\cdot)}u_2(a_1, a_2, a_3(a_1, a_2), a_4(a_1, a_2))\\ \end{cases} $$ (B) find $(a_1^*, a_2^*)\in A_1\times A_2$ such that $$ \begin{cases} a_1^*\in argmax_{a_1}u_1(a_1, a_2, a^*_3(a_1, a_2), a^*_4(a_1, a_2))\\ a_2^*\in argmax_{a_2}u_2(a_1, a_2, a^*_3(a_1, a_2), a^*_4(a_1, a_2))\\ \end{cases} $$ Question: a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is $$ \{a_1^*, a_2^*, \underbrace{a^*_3(\cdot), a^*_4(\cdot)}_{\text{Functions}}\} $$ or $$ \{a_1^*, a_2^*, \underbrace{a^*_3(a_1^*), a^*_4(a_2^*)}_{\text{Point in the image set of the functions $a^*_3(\cdot), a^*_4(\cdot)$}}\} $$ ?
Payoffs are $u_i(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ for $i = 1,2$. Suppose that I do the following (typically called backward induction): (A) find the functions $a^*_3(a_1,a_2)$ and $a^*_4(a_1,a_2)$ such that $$ \begin{cases} a_3^*(a_1, a_2)\in argmax_{a_3(\cdot)}u_1(a_1, a_2, a_3(a_1, a_2), a_4(a_1, a_2))\\ a_4^*(a_1, a_2)\in argmax_{a_4(\cdot)}u_2(a_1, a_2, a_3(a_1, a_2), a_4(a_1, a_2))\\ \end{cases} $$ (B) find $a_1^*, a_2^*$ such that $$ \begin{cases} a_1^*\in argmax_{a_1}u_1(a_1, a_2, a^*_3(a_1, a_2), a^*_4(a_1, a_2))\\ a_2^*\in argmax_{a_2}u_2(a_1, a_2, a^*_3(a_1, a_2), a^*_4(a_1, a_2))\\ \end{cases} $$ Which equilibrium notion I'm I applying?
An equilibrium consists of a profile of strategies, which specifies an action for every player at each possible contingency.

I'll give a try, perhaps it is just this first derivative giving you trouble: $$ \frac{d}{dt} ln \left( \frac{ \gamma_t + (n+\delta)}{sA} \right) = \frac{sA}{\gamma_t + (n+\delta)} \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{ \gamma_t + (n+\delta)}{sA} \right) $$ $$ = \frac{sA}{\gamma_t + (n+\delta)} \frac{\dot{\gamma}_t + 0}{sA} = \frac{\dot{\gamma}_t}{\gamma_t + (n+g)} $$ And the rest are simply the time derivative of a log equals its growth rate $ \left( \frac{d}{dt} ln X = \frac{\dot{X}}{X} \right) $: $$ \frac{d}{dt} \bigg[ (\beta-1) ln k_t + (\alpha + \beta - 1) ln N_t \bigg] = (\beta-1) \frac{\dot{k}_t}{k_t} + (\alpha + \beta - 1) \frac{\dot{N}_t}{N_t} $$ Hence concluding the time derivative is: $$ \frac{\dot{\gamma}_t}{\gamma_t + (n+g)} = (\beta-1) \frac{\dot{k}_t}{k_t} + (\alpha + \beta - 1) \frac{\dot{N}_t}{N_t} $$
Suppose an agent wants to maximize: $Max \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \ln(C_t) $ s.t. $C_t + I_t = Y_t$ $Y_t = K_t$ $K_{t+1} = K_t^\alpha I_t^\gamma$ where $\alpha, \gamma 0$ and $\alpha + \gamma  1$.
Notice that the elasticity can be written as $$\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}\cdot\frac{Y}{C}$$ So for category $1$ you have $$\frac{\Delta C_1}{\Delta Y}\cdot\frac{Y}{C_1}=0.
Next, differentiating with respect to time yields $\frac{dln(M)}{dt} + \frac{dln(V)}{dt} = \frac{dln(P)}{dt} + \frac{dln(Y)}{dt}$.

Or is there an entirely different solution? This would change the ration between industrial and "organic" meat. But you also do not insensitive the companies behind meat production to change their behavior.
I don't think there is right or wrong. This gives Singer a disutility of $\beta+(C-c)-(V-v)$ which is lower if $\beta$ is sufficiently high.
Most people think that \$50 is only 5% of the cost and so would not drive 1 hour away. Most people think that \$50 is 50% of the price and so would drive 1 hour to get the cheaper item.

Retaliation can lawfully take place only following authorization to suspend (tariff) concessions (that is, raise the level of customs duties on imports from the recalcitrant WTO member).
Is it simply the various Government ministries (eg the one responsible for food and agriculture), or is it Customs Officers?
As far as I am aware, there is no "general" international court for economic affairs. The ICJ (Interntaional Court of Justice) is the judicial organ of the UN, and it in fact decided few cases with economic background, but usually in the context of other questions of international law.
My understanding If Country A extends MFN status to Country B with reduced tariffs for a product, then it must treat all other nations in the same way.
The WTO explicitly prohibits subsidies on export goods to prevent dumping and market distortion but the United States spends $2.

According to some yes. She likewise argues that various past societies, such as early modern France, had peasantries with ample opportunity to enter into commercial production, which, however, did not take this opportunity.
In my view, Miller and Sanjurjo simply calculated the relative frequencies in Table 1 incorrectly. HH. , . 5 THHH - TH..
Most prominently, Wilson criticized the role of common priors in game theory. The equivalence fails in general, including in some quasilinear environments with budget balance.
QUESTION: Assume there are two types of products, labelled $l$ and $n$. What is the reasoning behind this equilibrium? Where I am stuck: I am told that there is another equilibrium which is characterized as: If the number of firms in the market and the parameter values are such that the monopoly profits from selling one product exceed the Cournot profits if all firms sell the other product, then, ignoring integer problems, equilibrium is found by setting the profits from selling the two products equal and so $N_l^*$ and $N_n^*$ satisfy $$ (1+\delta)(N_l^* + 1)(a - c_n)^2\left[(1+\delta)(N_l^*+1)(N-N_l^* + 1) - (N-N_l^*)^2 \right] = (N-N_l^* +1)(a+\gamma - c_n - c_p)^2\left[(1+\delta)(N-N_l^*+1)(N_l^*+1) - (N_l^*)^2 \right] \ \cdots \ (9) $$ $$ N_n^* = N - N_l^* \ \cdots \ (10) $$ If $\pi_l(1, N-1) \ge \pi_n(0, N)$ and $\pi_n(N-1, 1) \ge \pi_l(N, 0)$, then $N_l^*$ firms sell $q_l^* = Q_l(N_l^*, N_n^*)/N_l^*$ of $l$; $N_n^*$ sell $q_n^* = Q_n(N_l^*, N_n^*)/N_n^*$ of $n$ when equations (7), (8), (9), and (10) are satisfied.
I don't think it will have anything to do with $x_i$. Here is my thought: Given your setup, in order to find $\hat{\mu}$, we regress $y$ on an $n\times1$ vector of ones, $\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \vdots \\1\end{bmatrix}$ ,which we shall call $\iota$ (iota).

Factor 2 might thus be called a “radical” (or perhaps Marxist-feminist) grouping. Factor 3 might be an “Austrian” grouping, associating uncertainty, individualism and fallibilism.
The argument to have both share values converging is based on the fact that when the subsidiary redistributes the shares to the parent is similar to "unspining off".

In Avengers Infinity Wars the villain snaps his fingers and wipes out 50% of all living creatures. His rationale is that it will save people from starvation and collapse due to resource exhaustion in a finite universe.
If there aren't very many of them, they may be scarce. though in practice, people typically don't refer to unique objects as scarce.
Thanks for the link Mike J. My understanding is now that: A 'repo', short for 'repurchase agreement', is typically: Party 'A' (effectively a borrower - typically a bank) selling an asset (eg.
As a layman, I've always understood that there is a general consensus amongst economists that "immigration is economically beneficial" to rich Western countries (like Britain) who have aging populations because the influx of young economically active workers contributes to the economy (and tax coffers) and thereby supports the old economically inactive population.

(Technically, there's a third option: both actions being performed at the same time. ) The first option is not interesting as a one-off game, as choosing both boxes is clearly a dominant strategy.
I was surprised to find that we did not have a question on this Stack Exchange on this particular problem in decision theory.
However there are also very trivial 3x3 games with zero PSNE and exactly one MSNE, e.g. rock-paper-scissors. Eliminating a column and a row strategy is a nice idea.
In general the statement is wrong. Here is a counterexample: Suppose you have $f(k,l) = -k l^\beta$ with $\beta 0$ and $(k,l)\in\mathbb{R}^2_{++}$ (you can interpret $f$ as a production function for a "bad" commodity).

Assume that today you sell $N$ widgets for price of $3$. A asks in comments for "the amount I increase/decrease" The difference is just $M-N$, so just take the original formula and subtract $N$ from both sides: $$M - N  N \frac{2.
We can conclude that the elasticity of demand is -3. Is this true? Under what circumstances? Why? Thank's a lot! I have a exercise with the corresponding answer, but i don't get it: Suppose there's a better wheather this year and the size of the harvest of soy increased a 60%.

Your conjecture seems to be contradicted, at least for small values of $\sigma$. You can draw the function with the following R-code: qq_f = function(x,k,h,sig){ -pnorm(-k, sd=sig)*( (dnorm(h*(1-x), sd=sig))^2 ) - 0.
Unless you are trying to challenge yourself for fun or doing it as a practice exercise for students it does not make sense.
I have been reading several papers that use 2SLS. These papers usually also show the OLS regression results. I noticed that when authors report results for 2SLS, they also include control variables that were used in the OLS regression.
What you're trying to approximate is the quantity $$ \gamma(t) = \frac{{\rm d}\ln Q(t)}{{\rm d}\ln P(t)} $$ $\gamma = \gamma(t)$ is a function of time, the better sampling you have of $P$ and $Q$ the better estimation of $\gamma$ you are going to get.
Here is an interesting example, using an explicit Bartik instrument. Hope this helps. The Bartik instrument (from Bartik, 1991), also known as the shift-share instrument, is used as a typical instrument using 2-stage least squares regression.

Firstly, suppose we take a utilitarian welfare standard that is linear in money. For example, to set up a rail/telephone network requires that you lay train tacks/phone lines across the entire country.
This question really forces one to think about the role that quantity plays in the competitive equilibrium. 05, it will still be the case that no seller has any incentive to charge any less than P = MC1.
"Loss leader" is a term primarily from marketing. Those examples were about creating frictions to lock-in consumers, so that those same consumers could be charged a high price.

It is hard to measure accuracy in absolute terms because figuring out the truth is the problem that trials seek to solve in the first place.
, do you still live in this county, are you a U.S. Why Might A Prosecutor Fail To Object? So, if the prosecutor was really appalled by the dismissal for cause of so many women and felt that this would impair the prosecution's chance of obtaining a conviction materially, the prosecutor would have to dismiss the criminal charges so as to vacate the trial, before evidence was presented to the jury, and then refile the charges (assuming that this would be possible consistent with statutes of limitation and speedy trial requirements).
Conversely, the guilty plea and plea bargaining were until recently unknown to French law, and now it only applies to crimes for which the prosecution seeks a sentence not exceeding one year imprisonment.
How can this be possible? It also doesn't help that the rules governing judicial review of statutes and other governmental actions for their legality and constitutionality are rarely bright-line rules.

Choices for backlight are: Unknown, Fluorescent (CCFL), White LED, and RGD LED. Which of these should I select to match my built in screen?

This is a Minolta MD lens mount. It's hard to see in your photo, but by increasing the brightness, you can see the shutter-preferred auto-exposure lug (called the MD lug) (blue arrow), and the meter coupling (MC) tab (red arrow).
This appears to be the Minolta MC/MD mount. The giveaway is the aperture actuation lug inside the bayonet mount, and the notch in one of the bayonet tabs opposite the aperture lug, at the upper-left position of the bayonet ring in your 2nd photo.

xml" image_file Here is how Lightroom write in XMP keywords for file: lr:hierarchicalSubject rdf:Bag rdf:liEdfu/rdf:li rdf:liEgypt/rdf:li rdf:liancient/rdf:li rdf:liarcheology/rdf:li rdf:liarchitecture/rdf:li rdf:libuilding/rdf:li rdf:lihistory/rdf:li rdf:limuseum/rdf:li rdf:lireligion/rdf:li rdf:litemple/rdf:li rdf:litourism/rdf:li rdf:litravel/rdf:li /rdf:Bag /lr:hierarchicalSubject And this is accepted in all major stock agencies (Adobe, GettyImages, Shutterstock) as well as photo sharing or/and selling sites like 500px, Flickr The command you can use to incorporate this info in image is something like: exiftool "-xmp=xmp.
The XMP files created by Lightroom seems to follow the MWG description (website currently down), as it contains this link to describe its content : xmlns:mwg-rs="http://www.
"Contains" matches on partial words, e.g. if you select Keywords contains lon it will pick images with the keywords london, babylon, and alone.
If you have the photos on you android you can use the android app https://github. com/k3b/APhotoManager/ that i implemented.
So after a little digging and with the help of Murat's hint I found the following field in some pictures. This basically is the way that Adobe Lightroom stores the information and it could be used as a defacto standard in your project.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.
Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?
I'm probably waaaaay too late in answering to help you out with your decision (which I'm sure you've made already) but maybe my answer will help others who have a similar question.
Sorry if the question sounds flippant, it isn't meant to be, and I know that this is asking an opinion rather than a verifiable fact but bear with me...
Flickr is dying in the Yogi Berra sense: "Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded. " That is, it's lost some of its social media impact because it has become so dilute.

I’ve seldom got them immersed past the first section but that’s about 18” which is more than my wellies, so not a problem.
Sawgrass Gel Sublimation Inks (SubliJet-R) have been created in cartridges that fit the specific Ricoh printers. The ink lines would not work if the OEM inks were fed into the printer, so what your ad means is that no ink is in the lines and the printers are therefore "Sublimation Ready".
I've been looking around at various printers to use on-site for photo printing and one of the printers I came across was the Ricoh 3110DN and while I'm normally pretty good with this stuff, something confused me about the specs as on a couple of sites it is listed as being "sublimation ready" but then goes on to discuss the gel ink system it has.
Maybe, Ricoh Theta S matches your requirement. It has all the features you asked for which includes - HD recording (up to 25 mins), 30fps, Wi-Fi capability.
You can purchase a filter holder from Lee. http://www. leefilters. com/index. php/camera-directory/camera-dir-list/category/mounts-for-polyester-filters You can make a frame of cardboard to hold the polyester square in your holder.

Since the unit conversion says that W = J / s, so Ws = (J / s) * s = J, thus the unit J could just as well have been used.
A beauty dish gives a softer light than an unmodified flash, but not as soft as a softbox or shoot-through umbrella. This means that you can control the light more than when using a softbox.
Since the walls and ceiling are not cooperating, you'll have to actually move the SB700 off the camera. You can get a TTL cable for about $20.
My Canon 50D says the PC Sync port is good for 250V, any polarity. Sounds like it is driven by a bidirectional thyristor, triac or some such thing which has a recovery threshold.
Voila! Softened flash, no more Coccoon shots. You can use the translucent ones as diffusers for pop-up flashes. Take the lid off, cut a notch out of one side, place it on the flash and put the lid back on.

Wow, I haven't thought about that stuff in years. The best thing for you to do is to simply follow them. Of course the chemists that designed the paper and chemicals thought about all this and distilled it down to a set of easy to follow instructions.
The polar radiation pattern of Fig. 5 204 1 80 1. We get: dΩ = dS cos(θ) / (z² + r²) dΦ = I(θ) dΩ = I(0) dS cos²(θ) / (z² + r²) E(r) = dΦ / dS = I(0) cos²(θ) / (z² + r²) but since cos(θ) = z / √(z² + r²), and I(0) = E(0) z², E(r) = E(0) cos⁴(θ) = E(0) z⁴ / (z² + r²)² which leads to the following iluminance pattern, as a function of the distance r to the center of the spot: r (m) E (lx) 0 318 0.
I'm diving into the intimidating world of color darkroom prints (RA-4). I've heard some things (no safelight, needs to be the correct temperature, and so on).
I've shoot some Ilford HP5 + on a Mamiya 645 1000s for the first time. After scanning the negatives i noticed some strange things all over the images, big white dots (most prominent in the sky) like rain.
There are two hard limits on how fast a lens can be: The first is a thermodynamic limit. Then, the infinitesimal area dS on the image plane is conjugated with an infinitesimal portion of the object having a solid-angular size dΩ = dS/f 2.

I want to select image sensors for a particular application. One term that I have come across regularly in their datasheets is the CRA.
(Here's where I discovered that the new expanding lens hood did nasty things to the on-camera flash field :-) ). I have had no problems from staff while taking in-cabin photos of passengers with their permission.
Look to see what website in Hong Kong uses. China seems to block content with its Great Firewall, sometimes at random and changes policies almost daily.
For an image sensor, CRA relates to the positioning of the microlenses. 0 Deg CRA means the microlenses are centered right on the pixels.
I've been changing lenses with the camera on as long as I've been using DSLRs and I know a lot of other photographers who do the same.

You can use Excel to calculate the angle of view and distances enscoped by this field of view. 2/2/180*PI()))*2*0. 36 meters) =(TAN(50.
The angle of view is calculated by trigonometry. Generally the focal length will be a known value as will be the measurements of the rectangular image.
No, it isn't. Distance in a photograph taken with a regular lens is (ideally) proportional to actual distance in the scene, not angular distance.
What @tenmiles says is correct. I would make two modifications to make this more useful (which is what I played with before).

The best earplugs are the ones you have with you. It doesn't matter how well a set of earplugs blocks sound if you don't have them when you need them.
Have a look at "The Photographer's Eye". I found it superb and contains all the rules you can think of. http://www. amazon.
I'm referring to what's listed on Amazon under the configuration. Here's an example: https://www. amazon. com/Tamron-28-75mm-Aspherical-Digital-A09NII/dp/B001955P8W/ref=sr_1_4?
Scott Kelby I also follow Scott Kelby at http://www. scottkelby. com/blog/ I find that (apart from promoting his own training and books - which is not a bad thing) Scott gives a good load of news, and has a weekly guest blogger section, where another famous photographer writes an entry.
In addition to the tips you've listed in comments: Have the owners with the dogs. Dogs are pack animals, and they may be well adjusted but they might not be.

I'm using Draktable and it takes a long time to export all my images. | |===============================+======================+======================| | 0 GeForce GTX 108...
For anyone else who stumbles across this question, I found the FiveK dataset (from MIT/adobe) to be quite useful: https://data.
I discovered an artifact on a shot when I printed a large blowup of a tight crop. ---- Edit 2 ---- I compared an uncropped image on both "Aftershot" and "Darktable" for alignment in order to attempt to identify which 2-pixel shift is in error.
This is a bug in Corel's implementation of OpenCL Hardware GPU usage. The underlying problem is that Corel's OpenCL implementation shifts the exported layout by 2-pixels (approximately) in X  Y compared to other RAW to JPG (TIF too) conversions.
I would recommend the higher CPU in this case. The 610 is a bare bones "desktop" card that isn't really any better than the 4000.

I'll instantiate with portraits of these US Supreme Court justices: Stephen Johnson Field (November 4, 1816 – April 9, 1899) Rufus W.
6 ED The only obvious difference I see between them is that one is weather sealed and the other is not. However, they each list for $249.
for Pentax Cameras, there are two free possibilities: PK_Tether (freeware) which should work with: Pentax k-x, K7, K5, k-r, K20D, K10D, K200 - while the K-x and K-r are entry level, but very good cameras for the price second is pkTriggerCord (opensource) - which is for windows and linux which should fully support Pentax K-x, Pentax K10D (Samsung GX-10), Pentax K20D (Samsung GX-20), Pentax istDS, Pentax K200D, Pentax K-7, Pentax K-r, Pentax K-5, Pentax K-m/K2000 and limited support for istD, istDS2, istDL, K110D, K100D I have Pentax K-x and I am surely going to try both programs :-)
I'm going whale watching with a Pentax K5, I'm thinking of using a Pentax 60-250mm f/4 ED DA* SDM lens only as I don't want to change lenses while out at sea.
I have an old Pentax ME SUPER with three lenses, all of which have manual focus rings and no autofocus motors. Do new Pentax DSLRs have built-in focus motors that can deal with old lenses?

Many of the answers above compare the 24-105 Mark I to the 18-135 legacy version and find the 18-135 to be worse. However, when I compared the 24-105 Mark 1 to the 18-135 STM, I'm not seeing much of a difference.
If you're concerned at max aperture, the 70-200/2. 8 is sharper at f/2.8. http://www. the-digital-picture. com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops.
I do not own either of the two lenses. From experience, I'd say the zoom is the better choice for traveling. The versatility of a single lens providing multiple focal lengths is a key advantage.
You can only avoid it by avoiding to use the small aperture, or by getting a camera with larger sensor (such as a 12MP full frame, which can handle at least ~F11, maybe even F14).
A 70-200 L lens is pretty much epic. com/Reviews/ISO-12233-Sample-Crops. the-digital-picture. Lens=404Camera=453Sample=0FLI=4API=1LensComp=104CameraComp=453SampleComp=0FLIComp=4APIComp=1 280mm: http://www.

Of the four Canon zooms I have within arms reach at the moment: I had already noticed it in the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS a long time ago.
The most significant difference between the newer TS-E 50mm f/2. com. 8 at this listing by allphotolenses. There's a small version of the MTF chart released by Canon for the TS-E 45mm f/2.
There's a reason no one makes a 24-200mm FF lens. 5-6. 3 Di II VC is an APS-C only lens. It wouldn't work on your full frame 6D.
But I don't understand why F2. The front elements needed for such lenses can just fit in a lens with a barrel slightly larger than the throat diameters/flange rings of the most common interchangeable systems.
Teleconverters can only be used with specific lenses. Budget lenses, even telephoto ones, don't do very well with teleconverters.

Billingham are the classic camera bags - they scream camera to anyone who works as a photojournalist, but look like army surplus satchels to anyone else.
I don't have any experience photographing chocolate but there are several thing that just jump at me from the pictures on Smitten Kitchen.
Well, I'm afraid I don't have a snazzy diagram or picture for Clamshell Lighting... Because Clamshell Lighting = Butterfly Lighting, and thus the diagram is over on my Butterfly Lighting question/answer.
Like Sebastien mentioned, the library file is SQLite. I dug around in my own catalog and found that AgLibraryKeyword table.
I have often marveled (and gotten hungry) at the beautiful pictures in the blog Smitten Kitchen. On the the blogger's pictures, it looks glossy, shiny and yummy.

Most rumours about "battery memory" are somewhat true for NiCD, NiMH and lead acid batteries. NiMH batteries are still commonly used for flashguns, however they haven't been used as a standard power source for DSLRs for at least 15 years.
Some types of batteries have memory and their effectiveness is reduced if they are not fully charged and then used until fully discharged each time.
You are looking for low discharge rechargeables. Sanyo Enloop are the best known variety of these shelf stable rechargeables, but other brands include: Duracell Rechargeable "Pre-charged" Energizer 'Recharge" Rayovac "Hybrid" Note that some of these brands offer both low discharge and 'regular' so carefully read the label.
Some times I would go about 2~3 months without using my camera. I wonder how can one prolong the life of a digital camera battery.
What you're doing now is fine. Li-ion does not need to be fully charged for storage. In fact, the best state to store them in is between 30-70% charge, but I'd probably only bother with that if storing them for many months.

It's possible to record video with Canon 50D if you use the Magic Lantern Firmware. From the Magic Lantern Wiki: 50D: most functions working; it has a few stability problems; movie recording works!
I have a Paterson Universal Tank for developing film. It's written underneath that for 35mm we need 290ml to fill. I plan to put in 500ml into it.
Magic Lantern for Canon T3i has support for Bulb Ramping and Intervalometer. Personally I do use Magic Lantern on my 60D and had no problems with it but I have not tried those features yet.
There's no real way to "install" Magic Lantern (ML) to a camera. It always remains on the memory card that is used to boot the camera into ML when it is turned on.

Most of the optical controllers only cover an area about as wide as a 24mm lens on a FF camera. With the 700D, any radio system, including Canon's own RT system, will require a radio transmitter attached to the camera.
The YN968EX-RT uses the Canon RT radio protocol. The Yongnuo YN968EX-RT is not compatible with the YN622C protocol. It's also not compatible with the different YN560/RF603/RF605 protocol used by Yongnuo for manual only flashes.
Most of the optical controllers only cover an area about as wide as a 24mm lens on a FF camera. Difficulty with bright ambient light.
First off, please be sure to get the Nikon version of the YN568EX III. For full iTTL capability, you'd need a YN622N-TX or YN622N II.
Q1: I learned that YN685 has a build-in receiver. It's all covered quite well at Flash Havoc. Q5: For taking selfies with YN685, can I just hold a YN622TX and take pictures or do I have to leave YN622TX on the camera's hot shoe and get a camera remote??

The real change is the difference in Tv (shorter), Av (narrower), or ISO (lower) that the camera applies when you enter a lower EC number.
Therefore, how can I take into account and visualise in my sunny 16 evaluations with different ISOs, for example if I have 400 ISO film speed?
It all depends upon how the various ISO settings are implemented in your specific camera. This will usually be at the camera's native (that is, the lowest non-extended) ISO setting.
This is a kind of continuation of this question. I'm shooting a poorly lit object. Camera has fastest ISO value of 3200.
It sounds like the scene your were framing was outside the operating range of your 80D's meter. It's rated for EV 1-20.

As long as it is pressed the viewfinder will remain active. A quick look at the EOS 70D Instruction Manual indicates this is not an option with the 70D.
Many cameras will do either one depending on what settings are selected at the time. Most cameras typically override all such settings in fully auto shooting modes.
These are two common concepts in Nikon's ecosystem which I'll try to explain. To change it, hit the i button (bottom left next to the display) to bring on the info screen and select the second item on the last row - look for "S" and select it; back to the info screen, the first item on the last row should be AF mode.
If you are using AF-C/AI Servo AF, as long as the button is pressed the camera would continuously focus. If you are using a form of "One Shot" or AF-S focus.
The short answer is NO. Then take your thumb off the button and re-compose your shot to move your subject off-center. Focus on your subject by pressing the AF-ON button.

I got an upvote to this answer today which is usually a reminder to me to go visit old answers or questions to see if they have withstood the test of time.
Conclusion All in all, it's quite usable even though not directly supported. I installed the update, but no luck with getting Bridge to integrate properly with that version either.
It's not true. If corruption does occurs, it is the result of buggy firmware or software. You need to update your camera firmware or operating system, not format the card.
Lightroom 5 has completely changed how you actually work in this disconnected mode, so I will explain how to do this in LR5, then how to do it in LR4 and earlier, for those that do not have LR5 and later.
In most cases, user manual did not mention anything regarding this kind of issue.) Deleting causes no problems but must be done carefully.

There is another option for extreme macro: the Laowa 25mm f/2. 8 2. 5-5x. I got this because I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the Raynox, and my Nikon camera is not compatible with the MP-E 65mm.
Not to be taken as an answer, just a summary of the above plus a few observations. Under a plaster, slit the top of your belt slightly and lisp in there?
I'm probably waaaaay too late in answering to help you out with your decision (which I'm sure you've made already) but maybe my answer will help others who have a similar question.
Sorry if the question sounds flippant, it isn't meant to be, and I know that this is asking an opinion rather than a verifiable fact but bear with me...

If possible, please provide evidence based answer(URL). UPDATE: Let me elaborate please. But which is better for damping vibration, a magnesium cast or an aluminum alloy?
) How cold an environment can I safely use a carbon-fiber tripod in, and what precautions should I take? Is there a significant health or safety hazard beyond equipment damage?
Nikon Support tells me they issue no such specifications and I should always support the camera by the lens if the lens seems heavy.
Is there a list of most prestigious international photography awards? Sure there are lots. How authoritative they are, I have no idea.
Taken from http://www. eng-tips. com/viewthread. cfm? On the other hand, most of the damping present in structures has nothing to do with the material properties, but comes from other sources, such as bolted joints etc.

My question is whether this is a common practice among photographers? That said, I think most photographers also do try to think about composition when they're taking the shot, for the reasons I outlined above.
) No matter how beautiful I think they are, I promise them that I will not force them to do anything they aren't comfortable doing.
I'd suggest, though, that it's best separated from the vacation trips. (You can rent a Canon G12 for a week for less than $50.
The better camera will make it easier for you to go further, but if you don't have what I told you above, there will be not a lot of difference in your results.
And your current camera is more than capable of using off-camera lighting gear. It just means you own a pro-level dSLR.

Hope I'm understanding you correctly. There are two major clamp/plate types (maybe more) commonly seen: Manfrotto and Arca-Swiss.
Am I right? Are there no anti-twist plates or L-plates that are compatible with the Manfrotto system? From what I understand the L-plates and the camera specific anti-twist plates are only made for the Arca Swiss quick release system.
Tripods and heads have a standardized screw size. Where there is lack of standardization is quick release plates: each manufacturer has their own standard for quick release plates.
Hope it's possible. Thank you Are Manfrotto 200L and 501PL quick release plates interchangeable ? I want to buy a tripod with video head 501PL but want to use it only with small 200L quick release plate.
Kirk say Our custom machined camera and lens plates are Arca-style compatible P.S. RRS say all Really Right Stuff plates and rails will work in all screw-knob versions of Arca-Swiss style clamps.

I thought they move at so high speed that e.g. Is this current understanding correct? I previously incorrectly understood how the shutter curtains work.
The image recording is then ended with the normal rear curtain. This is different from an electronic shutter where the image recording is started/ended by a rolling readout (clearing/activating) of the pixel rows which can cause the "rolling shutter" effect.
And at higher SS's it is functioning as a completely electronic shutter... which is rolling readout, not global. It is basically recording one frame of video/live view output.
Flash sync speed has almost nothing to do with the duration of the flash. Even with electronic shutters, CMOS sensors must be read out one line at a time.
The easiest way to produce it, it to buy chucks the size of a small brick (5 pounds/each) of Dry Ice, which is Carbon Dioxide (CO2) frozen at temperature near to -109.
