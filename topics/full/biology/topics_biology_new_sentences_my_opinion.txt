However, if your REM sleep is disrupted even one night, your body won’t follow its normal circadian sleep cycle (“inner clock”) progression.
Lab tests for IgG may be increased in multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, MGUS, lymphoma, CLL, sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, autoimmune diseases, parasitic diseases, chronic infection, and intrauterine contraceptive diseases.

bacteria, bacterial, gram, negative, positive, wall, stain, bacterium, staining, crystal
On the other hand, Gram negative bacteria, due to a thinner peptidoglycan layer cannot retain crystal violet as well and are more likely to retain safranin.
I'm assuming that the crystal violet complexes that are retained in the gram positive bacteria's peptidoglycan layers end up being washed away (perhaps from overdehydrtation).

gel, buffer, band, sample, run, electrophoresis, sd, agarose, solution, running
For gel electrophoresis of DNA, we use TAE or TBE. TAE buffer is cheaper than TBE but it has low buffering capacity; it exhausts faster than TBE buffer and there is a need to change the buffer during gel electrophoresis when electrophoresis longer.
What is role of EDTA in sample buffer for protein separation for SDS-PAGE. In sample buffer preparation we add EDTA, but if SDS-PAGE is for protein then is it necessary to add EDTA in sample buffer?

The diastole consist of this: atrioventricular valves open, atria contract (atrial systole), blood flows from the atria to the ventricles, the atrioventricular valves close.
For further investigation into the progress of the blood pressure, we will measure a patient's blood pressure in the superior vena cava measured during inhalation and during an exhalation.

hair, follicle, keratin, grey, white, scalp, disulfide, bond, beard, curl
When I started shaving with a razor, the hair growth thickened. If a razor cuts only the hair, then how does hair thicken and become more rough with a razor shave and not after one using a trimmer?
Why is it that the scalp hair greys first? But it seems like it is the scalp hair that becomes grey first.

It increases the understanding of the classification of the different neurons, but you will inevitably encounter shady areas where things fall apart; consider the fact that the retina is often regarded to be a part of the CNS, because of its embryonic development (Purves, 2002).
For example, if a vesicle was being transported from the plasma membrane to the Golgi and then to the ER, the first part of this journey would be along the plus end to the minus end of the microtubule, carrier by dyneins; the second part of the journey from Golgi to ER would be from minus and to plus and and therefore carried by kinesis.

textrm, circ, decomposers, mon, t, biorep, dried, detritus, v, sludge
Are detrivores and decomposers both types of saprotrophs? Detrivores and decomposers are distinct, as it says on Wikipedia, in the fact detrivores consume macroscopic clumps of detritus while decomposers metabolise detritus on a microscopic scale.
Wikipedia writes: In human anatomy, and in mammals in general, the mons pubis (also known simply as the mons, and known specifically in females as the mons Venus or mons veneris), is a rounded mass of fatty tissue found over the pubic symphysis of the pubic bones.

hatching, s_f, modulus, s_m, fry, asynchrony, fitness, fittest, homozygote, male
Does it mean hatching asynchrony has fitness benefits? Or does it mean hatching asynchrony is likely to be selected for?
In this case, hatching asynchrony merely correlates with fitness, but does not cause fitness to increase and is thus not adaptive.

antibiotic, resistance, resistant, penicillin, staphylococcus, aureus, grid, ccr, lactamase, methicillin
Since antibitiotic resistance is caused by transduction of the F factor, is it possible to induce a F+ non antibiotic resistant bacteria into a region of F- resistant bacteria?
FMRSA (meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) became resistant to penicillin by a change in its DD-transpeptidase.

Try this: $f(x)=-20(e^{\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(x-10,\ 20\right)-10\right)}*(e^{5\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(x-10,\ 20\right)-10\right)}-57*e^{4\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(x-10,\ 20\right)-10\right)}+302*e^{3\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(x-10,\ 20\right)-10\right)}-302*e^{2\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(x-10,\ 20\right)-10\right)}+57*e^{\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(x-10,\ 20\right)-10\right)}-1))/(e^{\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(x-10,\ 20\right)-10\right)}+1)^7$

mutagen, carcinogen, carcinogenic, hd, mutagenic, al_, iarc, carcinogenesis, residue, oncogenic
Not all mutagens are carcinogens. I'm no expert on the matter, but just quoting from Wikipedia: Mutagens are not necessarily carcinogens, and vice versa.
There are many substances listed as carcinogens bu IARC but they are not mutagenic.

Therefore, the twin created in this way will have the same DNA sequence, but it will be a subject to disorders associated with imprinting
Say, engineer reaction that will modify histamine using radioactive-labeled compound and then measure how fast/slow amount of the compound decreases

photoreception, extraretinal, time, also, one, population, size, would, level, specie
Why would evolution have lead to extraretinal photoreception in mammals?
Arrangement with the receptor cell behind a screen of several other layers not hinder the process of photoreception by blocking a lot of incident light and hence the formed image?

meiosis, egg, secondary, oocyte, sperm, primary, ovum, division, ii, follicle
3 hrs before ovulation, the Pre ovulatory Follicle (with the secondary oocyte inside) is arrested in the metaphase of Meiosis II and is extruded out of the ovary - a process called as Ovulation.
After ovulation, each oocyte continues to metaphase of meiosis II. Which follicle is arrested in the metaphase II of oogenesis?

O- should be the universal donor not O+ because when rh- blood is given to rh+ person ,the rh+ person can not make antibodies against rh- blood because there are no rh antigens in the rh- blood.
If Rh- mother has Rh+ baby, the mother can become sensitized during first pregnancy and then if subsequent fetuses are also Rh+, there can be eryhtroblastosis foetalis.

This is why, digitalis intoxication is relative contraindication to electric cardioversion of atrial fibrillation/flatter.
It is antiarrhythmic agent against supraventricular arrhythmias. Why is electrical cardioversion contraindicated in Digitalis Poisoning of AF treatment?

Note: We crossed Rhododendron flammeum (diploid) X Rhododendron atlanticum (tetraploid) to produce triploid seedlings.
If you plant your zucchini and cross your zucchini flower with pollen from spaghetti squash and orange-fleshed squash, you will end up with a zucchini fruit filled with seeds that are either half spaghetti squash or half orange-fleshed squash.

Inert gas narcosis and HPNS. Nitrogen Narcosis or more commonly Gas Narcosis is the narcotic effect of gasses like Oxygen and Nitrogen under pressure.
So, Argon is 40% denser than N2 (and also denser than O2 and denser than air). , Tang, J.
