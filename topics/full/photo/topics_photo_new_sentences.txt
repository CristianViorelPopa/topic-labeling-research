I have observed the following when attending first meetings as a professional retoucher: Clients like to talk about their Company, their vision, their pain-points and what they need from a photographer/Photo Retoucher (some of these points relate to non-business Customers too) Once they have provided their information, they like to better understand me and at this point, along with any hard copy Portfolio, I find it very reassuring to also show them any relevant qualifications, certifications and awards that I have achieved.

If you use the add-on 622 TTL/HSS triggers, you'll have full TTL/HSS/power control over the new TTL speedlight, but you lose power control over the YN-560IV (which can only be power-controlled from a YN-560-TX).
Keep in mind that radio triggers, like optical systems and sync cables, also come in manual-only and TTL/HSS/remote-power control flavors.

The only way to avoid overexposure messing with your colours is to set the histogram to show all three colour channels (red, green and blue) and to check that none of the graphs is bunched up at the right-hand side, which would indicate a colour maxing out.
Thus, even though the R and B channels always are fully recoverable by drastically changing white balance or color settings (which may not be desirable), they may still appear clipped in the final result (appearing as so-called "nuclear colors").

What is going on with the left most windmill? Ok, check this shot out: These are the 3 windmills in Marshfield Massachusetts.
If you push it enough you'll also get "halos" around the windmill silhouettes. So the border between the dark hillside and the brighter sky is emphasized by the use of the dehazing tool.

In USB, there's no guaranteed bandwidth available. Emulating Firewire over USB is quite difficult, as technology is so different.
USB 2. 5 Mbps. Now, this is theoretical, because every USB or Firewire device connnected utilizes bandwidth.

In the case of Fata Morgana, there can be several inferior mirages, and superior reflections of those inferior mirages (creating the stacked mirages).
Or, there is a low-vision mode which makes the cursor humongous. This is just a guess, but the cursor is often shoveled in by the hardware.

Aliasing is result of sampling, taking discrete samples or readings of a signal, at a low enough frequency that the frequencies in the input signal are confused for other frequencies, such that they cannot be distinguished from each other.
The top plot in the figure below shows a 1Hz sine wave sampled at the Nyquist rate, which for this sine wave is 2Hz.

I wouldn't restrict yourself to the Spanish speaking community (although I believe Spanish to have fractionally more native speakers than English, so it's a pretty big audience); Instead look at the picture agencies that operate in your area.
So this is like most digital security issues, it will prove authenticity or monumental effort to circumvent it ;)

All this talk of chimps and keepers makes me sound like I work at the zoo. With digital, a quick chimp at the histogram and blown highlight warnings, adjust, and you're ready to go.
Chimp then say "Wow, that is great, you look amazing!". Always smile when you chimp even if you don't mean it becasue your subject will be watching you.

Short Lighting Example: Broad lighting can add weight to a thin face, but it does this by 'adding' roundness/thickness to the face, so it is not a good style of lighting to use with bigger subjects (or even 'normal' subjects with rounder faces.

I've spent some time in Lightroom setting up tag synonyms and hierarchies to get a structure I'm happy with: And I really want to include most of these synonyms in the exported images.

For the uninitiated, it stands for “Super Electron Beam Coating” – a moniker devised in the days when men walked on the moon and words like “electron” and “beam” conjured up visions of a Jetson-like futurama.
The AF-Beam is is used while the camera focuses but before it meters. In any type of Continuous AF this is not usually the case, so , the AF-beam must be turned off.

These are also available on Flickr and PicasaWeb. PicasaWeb provides great value for money with large capacity for little money.

Lens cleaning tools are a blower, a microfiber cloth, and lens cleaning fluid. Try to blow up dust off the lens with the blower or canned air.

temperature, water, weather, camera, bag, lens, air, inside, cold, plastic
Moving a warm camera into colder air is not a problem, but moving a cold camera into warm air will cause condensation.
Let the lens get down to the outside temperature. Just remember to put the lens back in the bag when you go back into the heated area, to prevent the warm wet air inside the house from condensing on the cold lens.
