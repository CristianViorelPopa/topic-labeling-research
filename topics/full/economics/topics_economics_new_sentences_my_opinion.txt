I might be wrong but from what you write, it seems you've been given a "classical" introduction to econometrics: You've covered IVs and Diff-in-diff but apparently only in passing, and causal inference does not look like it was the core of the classes you've taken.

country, rate, currency, exchange, price, export, good, usd, u, foreign
Assuming China has a 30% inflation rate, while USA and Lebanon have 0 inflation rate, then the fact that the inflation rate differential between China and USA is 30%, while the Chinese nominal exchange rate was devalued by only 20%, implies that in real terms, the Chinese currency (relative to both the USD and Lebanese Pound) has actually appreciated by approximately 10%=30%-20%.
Furthermore, before having a deficit, the US has had a surplus for a very long time, so it is natural it would eventually have a deficit.

Simple supply and demand economics would suggest that the huge increase in the supply of rooms to rent by Airbnb should have reduced the price of rental significantly in those cities where Airbnb is most popular.
We find Airbnb’s presence in a market has a negative effect on hotel occupancy rates, but a positive effect on total hotel revenue and the average daily rate they charge.

I assume that weighting COL in MW particularly is better than weighting COL in average wage (AW), because, although there are few families with extremely high wages, their wages bias AW extremely upwards, while MW is less effected from such extreme cases.
These factors are in general not likely to be pecuniary, so they are usually treated as a residual - if MW/COL in state A is less than MW/COL in state B, then the difference must be due to improved amenities in state A.

If we consider the definition of a Nash Equilibrium,and carefully consider the strategy sets for each player, we can see there are at least 10 Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria.
It just sounds odd that all along, Harsanyi allows a player's type to be unknown only to other players, but in the end, no matter what, whether you have various types or not, the payoffs must be computed in expectation.

They also find that dropping the wealth taxes didn't change this pattern, however, they attribute this to an "equalizing force".
A major concern is also that a substantial share of the private wealth of the top 1% is invested in productive firms which employ millions of people.

homothetic, psi_u, matched, nu, nu_s, twice, seller, forall, au, ay
Here's another way, using the same notation as Adam, to get to the same result: $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = P(\text{searching twice | being matched})\cdot P(\text{another match | searching twice}) $$ Now, $$P(\text{searching twice | being matched}) = \frac{P(\text{searching twice and being matched})}{P(\text{being matched})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s} $$ $$P(\text{another match | searching twice}) = \frac{P(\text{another match and searching twice})}{P(\text{searching twice})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} $$ So, $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s}\frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} = \frac{2\psi_u\nu}{(1+\psi_u)}$$
Obviously, if a utility function on a set of consumption bundles is homothetic, then the preference relation is homothetic.

If there is any segregation in economic enterprise between the races then it may be rational for whites to seek education and blacks to not.
Thus the intended effect of emission right certificates would be undermined. If a company emits more than it is allowed to it pays a fine (to the country where the pollution occurs).

A my attempt: a) for A: $C_2^A=(Y_1^A-C_1^A)(1+r) + Y_2^A$ for borrow this becomes: $C_2^A=(C_1^A-25,000)(1+200/100)+15,000$ or, $ C_2^A=3C_1^A-60000$ for lend this becomes: $C_2^A=(25,000-C_1^A)(1+0/100)+15,000$ or, $C_2^A=40,000-C_1^A$ my idea was to supersede one over the other and draw the kinked budget line but the borrow budget line in this case is totally below the x-axis and similarly for Mr.B.
I am not interested in the overall impact pay-to-play has on all youth sport participants.

When does the liability become funded or unfunded? And if it is unfunded, at what point does it become funded?
Technology C, which has a lifetime of 25 years. Technology B, which has a lifetime of 20 years.

Under ordinal utility you can only say that Lisa prefers ice cream to cereal, but you can’t say that she derives let’s say twice as big utility $u$(cerial)=10 and $u$(ice cream)=20.
In turn, as ice cream prices rise, producers make more of it, and thus more skim milk.

year, gdp, value, data, variable, would, price, capital, time, growth
For example, in the release notes for quarterly GDP of the US economy (see link above), towards the end there is a section called "Updates to GDP".
But in reality, in order to obtain an actual value for this price index (and hence also of inflation), we must specify a base period, against which we will evaluate the price index for the other periods (past and future).

monthly, percentage, f_t, decimal, mdp, formula, zone, target, yearly, expressed
The monthly payment formula is based on the annuity formula. Since the quoted yearly percentage rate is not a compounded rate, the monthly percentage rate is simply the yearly percentage rate divided by 12.
So monthly percent should be 0. Why monthly present in on line monthly payment calculator calculated as annual percent divided by 12?

l_k, aircraft, movement, cap, cup, subset, pregnant, type, collective, negative
You take a pregnancy test if the pregnancy test gives a positive result when you are not pregnant then this is a false positive, a Type I error when the null hypothesis $H_0$ is in fact true but has been rejected by the test if the pregnancy test gives a negative result when you are pregnant then this is a false negative, a Type II error when the null hypothesis $H_0$ is in fact untrue but has not been rejected by the test So in a statement of being a true/false positive/negative test, the true/false part is about the accuracy of the test while the positive/negative part is about the result of the test rather than being the real situation
So my question is, how do the pregnancy analogy and whole 'false positive' & 'false negative' thing make sense?

Bottom line we can demonstrate it, but its logically consistent enough for us to take it for granted.

From here, we get that \begin{equation} \begin{split} u_i(v_i)  \geq v_iq(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'})\\ =v_iq(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'}) + v_i^{'}q(v_i^{'}) - v_i^{'}q(v_i^{'}) \\ = (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'}) + (v_i^{'}q(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'}))\\ = (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'}) + u_i(v_i^{'}), \,\,\, or, \\ u_i(v_i)-u_i(v_i^{'})  \geq (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'})\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, -(1) \end{split} \end{equation} Similarly, we can get $$u_i(v_i^{'})-u_i(v_i) \geq (v_i^{'} - v_i)q(v_i)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, -(2)$$ From $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get that $$(v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'}) \leq u_i(v_i)-u_i(v_i^{'}) \leq (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i)$$ Given the above expression, is it possible to write the expected utility function as $$u_i(v_i) = u_i(a) + \int_a^{v_i}q_i(t)\, dt,$$ for any distribution.
That is the reason why you can write $$u_i(v_i) \geq u_i(v_i^{'}) = v_iq(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'})$$ instead of $\widetilde u_i (v_i^{'},v_i) = v_iq(v_i^{'},v_i)-m_i(v_i^{'},v_i)$.

What's the difference between "industrial capitalism" and "agrarian capitalism" and "mercantilism" and the "industrial revolution" and the 20th century ideas of "Keynesianism"?
You are talking about the inverse of the exploitation rate. Surplus value = exploitation rate x use value Wages = (1/exploitation rate) x use value

I'm having trouble showing Roy's identity for the following Stone-Geary utility function: $$U(x)=\prod_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\gamma_i\right)^{\beta_i}$$ where $\sum \beta_i=1$ and $\gamma_i$ is the minimal consumption of $x_i$.

However, crucial caveat here is that this holds only asymptotically and only for $R^2$ close to unity.

Too low, and the opposite happens: sell bonds; less money; less excess reserves; more borrowers; higher interest rates; lower inflation.
Or more aptly, they may believe the only way you can pay this interest is by printing money, decreasing the value of money and potentially leading to inflation or a runaway zimbabwe situation So the destruction of currency reduces the financial liabilities of a central bank, benefitting its balance sheet.

Sometimes, companies that are essentially still under the control of the founders even though they have done an initial public offering and are now publicly traded will do a secondary offering in which the company itself purchases stock from the founders, and sells that stock on the market, rather than actually issuing new stock.
