I use a Dickey-Fuller test to test for stationarity and concluded that both of my series are non-stationary.
I might be wrong but from what you write, it seems you've been given a "classical" introduction to econometrics: You've covered IVs and Diff-in-diff but apparently only in passing, and causal inference does not look like it was the core of the classes you've taken.
An urn contains equal number of green and red balls. The ball is then placed back in the urn, and the selection process is repeated.
The expected number of superballs is the expected number of urns with a nonzero number of red balls.
$good_2(good_1)$), which simplistically means solving $good_1= -a\times good_2 +b$ for $good_2 $; $$ good_2(good_1)=-\frac{1}{a}\times good_1 +\frac{b}{a}$$ i.e.
Do I need to convert the governance indicators (-2. All indicators range from -2.
Say I have $U$ urns, and some balls. Some urns will have more than one ball, some might have none.
What you shall do is to test for stationarity of residuals obtianed from cointegration vector.
It seems that the Coase Theorem presume that if a deal can be made, it will be made.

Although I am not a macroeconomist, I am confident to say that search models recognized as a key ingredient to explain unemployment in equilibrium.
The other question is whether there is any effect colloquially similar to the 'magical chairs' game in which the latest resident to move into a region of increased popularity will not reap the rewards obtained by the prior residents?
Similarly, Army 2 attacks ($A$) in both types in this case. Say, we have $\textbf{(A,NA)}$ as army 1's strategy and $\textbf{(A,A)}$ as army 2's strategy, it means, Army 1 attacks ($A$) when it is of type "Strong" and does not attack ($NA$) when it is of type "Weak".

Assuming China has a 30% inflation rate, while USA and Lebanon have 0 inflation rate, then the fact that the inflation rate differential between China and USA is 30%, while the Chinese nominal exchange rate was devalued by only 20%, implies that in real terms, the Chinese currency (relative to both the USD and Lebanese Pound) has actually appreciated by approximately 10%=30%-20%, leading to Chinese exports looking more expensive to Americans and Lebanese, and American and Lebanese imports looking cheaper to the Chinese.
Furthermore, before having a deficit, the US has had a surplus for a very long time, so it is natural it would eventually have a deficit.
The Australian economy is almost tied to the hip to China – about one-third of its exports go to Greater China and, perhaps more importantly, two-thirds of its exports are products where China sets the price: coal, iron ore, wool, metals, etc.
For this given nominal exchange rate, my purchasing power would decline if I exchanged all my pounds to dollars, as U.S.A.
I know that if a country exports more than it imports (a "favorable" balance of trade), there is a greater demand for its goods - and thus, a greater demand for its currency - on the Foreign Exchange Market.
This will have two effects: (a) this will shift the IS curve further to the right (because net exports have risen, and so Y has risen) and (b) this will shift the BP curve to the right (because net exports have risen, improving the current account balance).
I'm reviewing a previous AP Macroeconomics exam and I saw the following question: The United States and South Korea are trading partners, and the United States has a zero current account balance.
For this question, I feel like it would not be possible to derive a preference relation of the entire electorate because it seems that no one candidate is strongly/weakly preferred.
In countries with high infant and child mortality rates, however, the average number of births may need to be much higher.
if the home country's inflation rate is lower than that of the foreign country, then all else equal, the home currency should depreciate in real terms as the domestic consumption basket becomes cheaper relative to the foreign consumption basket some of the confusion abounds because of the different quoting conventions (X vs 1/X, foreign vs domestic, etc)

price, market, agent, model, bid, asset, stock, auction, expectation, seller
This is the very general statement that can be found from here and there: Investopedia: This principle is called the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which asserts that the market is able to correctly price securities in a timely manner based on the latest information available.
In general, the difference between the fundamental value of an asset and its market price constitutes, to some degree, bubble behavior.
For example: Buyers: Buyer 1: bid price = 30 cent Buyer 2: bid price = 25 cent Buyer 3: bid price = 20 cent Buyer 4: bid price = 15 cent And the ask prices of the sellers per item: Sellers: Seller 1: ask price = 25 cent Seller 2: ask price = 20 cent From what I understand is, that there would be just one clearing price and Buyers 1 and 2 will both purchase an item from Seller 1 and 2 for 20 cent, instead of 30 and 25 cent.
In your example, the market clearing price is $25$ as there are two buying bids at that price or higher and two selling bids at that price or lower, and no other price achieves this match So Buyer $1$ and Buyer $2$ both pay $25$ and Seller $1$ and Seller $2$ both receive $25$ If you want actual examples, you could look at the shares of Tottenham Hotspur Limited (the football club) on Asset Match and the Auction results (almost every month) in the right hand column.
Hence, the weights of all assets in the market portfolio must be non-negative as well.
The key to problems like this is that it cannot be simplified to one representative buyer and one representative seller.
In addition to this, complete or incomplete markets have always the so-called Arrow-Debreu sense of complete/incomplete markets?
The new classicals sidestepped the problem of aggregation either by imagining an economy composed of identical individuals or by assuming that there is one individual who represents the whole economy, so that the solution to the optimization problem of this representative agent gives the aggregate relationships in that economy.
Iterative Auction: The auctioneer repeats the auction and the traders submit bids/asks until a purpose (welfare maximization etc.
In current mainstream macro practice, the representative-agent (RA) assumption (of DSGE models and nearly identified with them) side-steps the SMD: The theorems of Hugo Sonnenschein, Rolf Mantel and Gerard Debreu in the early 1970s established that the restrictions that generate well-behaved individual demand functions do not constrain aggregate demand functions to exhibit the same properties [...].

steel, soybean, c_a, signaling, t_k, mutant, beer, spence, separating, majority
Because of this multiplicity a large literature on equilibrium refinements, such as the intuitive criterion or divinity, has emerged.
For example, "single-dipped" preference profiles (the vertical mirror image of "single-peaked" profiles) also produce transitive majority preferences.
But this is really bad in general, here's a better approach $$ \frac{{\rm d}\ln P(t_k)}{{\rm d}t} \approx \frac{-2\ln P(t_k + 2h) + 8\ln P(t_k + h) - 8\ln P(t_k - h) + \ln P(t_k - 2h)}{12h} \tag{2} $$ So to give you an idea, if you are measuring the elasticity on ($t_k$ = November 2018) with data measured each month, you will need to know the prices and quantities for ($t_k - 2h = $ September 2018), ($t_k - h = $ October 2018), ($t_k + h = $ December 2018) and ($t_k + 2h = $ January 2019).
So single peaked preferences is a sufficient condition. I understand that when individuals have single-peaked preferences, majority rule will be transitive and the choice set will be non-empty.
2 tons of steel. This is because by producing 1 ton of steel, the American forgoes 25 tons of soybeans, while the Chinese forgoes only 10 tons.
Does it have anything to do with the refinements such as intuition criterion? However, in screening, pooling equilibrium does not exist, and the range for separating is also narrower than in signaling.
The intuitive criterion by Cho and Kreps is a refinement to minimise the set of perfect Bayesian equilibria in signalling games.
For example, a mutant could play $b$ against another mutant but play $a$ against a non-mutant.
We say that the profile P is single-peaked if there is some way to order the alternatives in A (e.g.
In game theory the concepts of strong equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, divine equilibrium, intuitive criterion, evolutionarily stable strategy are all equilibrium refinements.

There are papers that propose social choice rules whose output is an incomplete social preference relation (or even an intransitive social preference relation), and their authors might still describe these rules as satisfying "unrestricted domain" because all they ever wanted was an incomplete (or even intransitive) relation.

Just integrate out $(t_i,t_{-i})$ in $\Pr(a_i,a_{-i},t_i,t_{-i},\theta)$ to get that joint distribution.
I get something like this: $\int^\bar\theta_\underline\theta u(\theta) dF(\theta) = u(\theta)F(\theta)|^\bar\theta_\underline\theta - \int^\bar\theta_\underline\theta F(\theta)v_\theta(q(\theta),\theta)d\theta$ I can simplify this a bit further, but it does not simplify to the authors' expression.
Similar argument for 2.8. By definition we have $$ \begin{align*} u(\theta)  = \theta q(\theta)-t(\theta) \\ \\ u(\theta + \delta)  = (\theta + \delta) q(\theta + \delta)-t(\theta + \delta) \end{align*} $$ By incentive compatibility (where $\theta + \delta$ is the true type, $\theta$ is the false type) we have $$ u(\theta + \delta) \geq (\theta + \delta) q(\theta)-t(\theta) $$ Using these (I used square brackets for clearer notation, there is no mathematical function to them) $$ \begin{align*} u(\theta + \delta) - u(\theta)  = \left[(\theta + \delta) q(\theta + \delta)-t(\theta + \delta)\right] - \left[\theta q(\theta)-t(\theta)\right] \\ \\ u(\theta + \delta) - u(\theta)  \geq \left[(\theta + \delta) q(\theta)-t(\theta)\right] - \left[\theta q(\theta)-t(\theta)\right] \end{align*} $$ This also holds if you divide by $\delta  0$.

Both supply and demand share the same change in quantity as a result of the tax, so $$\Delta Q_S = \Delta Q_D$$ The amount by which the quantities changed is the derivative of that quantity wrt price, times the change in price that side experienced $$\frac{\partial Q_S}{\partial P_S}\Delta P_S = \frac{\partial Q_D}{\partial P_D}\Delta P_D$$ Multiply both sides by the equilibrium P/Q $$\frac{\partial Q_S}{\partial P_S}(\frac{P^*}{Q^*})\Delta P_S = \frac{\partial Q_D}{\partial P_D}(\frac{P^*}{Q^*})\Delta P_D$$ which of course is the formula for elasticity at the equilibrium $$\varepsilon_S \Delta P_S = \varepsilon_D \Delta P_D$$ $$\frac{\varepsilon_S}{\varepsilon_D}\Delta P_S = \Delta P_D$$ So then the producer's share is $$Incidence_S=\frac{P^*-P_S}{T}=\frac{|\Delta P_S|}{|\Delta P_S|+|\Delta P_D|} = \frac{|\Delta P_S|}{|\Delta P_S|+|\frac{\varepsilon_S}{\varepsilon_D}\Delta P_S|}$$ the price change cancels out and you get producer's share as $$Incidence_S=\frac{1}{1+|\frac{\varepsilon_S}{\varepsilon_D}|}=\frac{|\varepsilon_D|}{|\varepsilon_D|+\varepsilon_S}$$ So it all comes from the fact that this is the unique formula that produces the price-change ratios that generate identical quantity changes in both sides of the market.

Let's address your question in a canonical manner. the interest rate or the cost of debt is denoted by $r_D$ (naturally $r_D  r$) the share of debt in the capital structure of the company is denoted by $X\%$ the corporate tax rate is denoted by $T_c$ It follows that the average cost of capital (average over equity and debt), $r'$, is such that $r' = X\% r_D (1-T_c) + (1-X\%) r$ In your case, $X\% = 100\% = 1$, then $r' = r_D(1-T_c)$.
So then both would go for the evening. Two airlines, Airtouch and Windward, are scheduling flights for either morning or evening.
In mixed strategies I found, that $(\sigma_A, \sigma_B)$ is a Nash-Equilibrium with: $$\sigma_A(1) = \sigma_B(1) = \frac{6}{13}$$ $$\sigma_A(2) = \sigma_B(2) = \frac{4}{13}$$ $$\sigma_A(3) = \sigma_B(3) = \frac{3}{13}$$ The problem sheet now asks to argue with an example why no further mixed Nash equilibrium can exist.

While studying globalisation, The subject of Trade Blocs was brought up, with hindsight, I wondered, aren't Trade Blocs fostering regionalism (as in devotion to the interests of one's own region) as opposed to globalisation?
27 pounds for a yard of cloth in both places). He supposes that 20 yards of cloth takes the same amount of effort to make as 4 quarters of corn in England, but in Poland the effort to make 4 quarters of corn is the same as that to make 10 yards of cloth.
Therefore the certainty equivalent must be $\geq 50$. The lottery you show is equivalent to having two lotteries, one where you get \$50 with certainty and one with the following payoffs: \$0 with probability 1/3 \$50 with probability 1/3 \$100 with probability 1/3 The first lottery has a certainty equivalent of \$50.
So regionalism does not go against globalization. Although the verdict is not yet in, the evidence indicates that regionalism is broadly liberalizing.
It depends on the importing country or bloc (X), and the country the import is coming from (Y), and the product category (Z).

Simple supply and demand economics would suggest that the huge increase in the supply of rooms to rent by Airbnb should have reduced the price of rental significantly in those cities where Airbnb is most popular.
1Associate head of the School for Aviation and Security at Buckinghamshire New University Note 1: This question does not belong on Aviation.
We find Airbnb’s presence in a market has a negative effect on hotel occupancy rates, but a positive effect on total hotel revenue and the average daily rate they charge.
But if that is the case, perhaps the demand for the short-term rental in that city has increased?
Even though Romeo likes apples himself but he loves to see Juliet consume his favorite fruit twice as much.
Some readers may want to know that an elastic demand can either be unitary elastic ($E_d = −1$) or relatively elastic ($−∞  E_d  −1$).
) Out of convenience, the intermediate microeconomics student will often compute something called $MU_A$ and $MU_B$ and these can often be evaluated as actual numbers.
My understanding is that when demand is elastic, a price reduction will increase total revenue.

, McGraw-Hill 2005, for more on total differentials. For the first step, as in your previous question, simply use the rules of total differentials, specifically the product rule that states that for variables $X$ and $Y$, the total differential of $XY$ is given by $$d(XY) = Y \, dX + X \, dY$$ Assuming that $s_\pi$, $s_W$ and $\zeta$ are (constant) parameters (so that by the constant rule, $ds_\pi = ds_W = d\zeta = 0$), we can apply this to your equation: $$\begin{align} d\mu  = d \left[ s_\pi - v (s_\pi - s_W) + \zeta \right] \\  = ds_\pi - d \left[ v (s_\pi - s_W) \right] + d\zeta \\  = -\left[ (s_\pi - s_W) \, dv + v \, d(s_\pi - s_W) \right] \\  = -(s_\pi - s_W) \, dv \end{align}$$ Now divide both sides by $\mu$, noting that since $\dot v = \frac{ dv }v$, we also have $dv = v \dot v$: $$\begin{align} \dot\mu = \frac{ d\mu }\mu  = -\frac{ dv }\mu (s_\pi - s_W) \\  = -\frac v\mu (s_\pi - s_W) \dot v \end{align}$$ which is the desired result.

But with fairness preferences, player 2 will actually decline low positive offers as unfair.
Thing is, many theories of utility (and behavioral economics experiments) expect that it can be nonlinear, and that "50% chance of +100 and 50% chance of -100" and "certain 0" are not equivalent, there can be a strong preference for one or the other depending on circumstances.

Having been around members of all these organizations, I found them all to be out of touch although I would say that ideally, Libertarianism makes more sense to me these days, but grabbing on to an ideology is never a good way to develop a full and healthy understanding of economics and our world today.
Mises’s answer is that economics is the science of human action… It is this assessment of economics as an a priori science, a science whose propositions can be given a rigorous logical justification, which distinguishes Austrians, or more precisely Misesians, from all other current economic schools.
Among the references in the paper hinted by indigo_luc, there's one (Mearman, 2011), which [was apparently the first that] has surveyed some (43) self-styled heterodox economists and applied factor analysis as well as cluster analysis to their ideas: [The first factor is addressed in the next para.
So I do not think it is at all correct to define market failure as when "the production or consumption of a good or service causes additional positive or negative externalities on a third party not involved in the economic activity".
The first is governed by uncertainty: the good’s value is what the customer is willing to pay, it difficult for the seller to calculate all the costs involved in selling the good, and without specialization there is no knowledge to calculate how much of items must be sold for price X to reach the certain profitability.
Something like the effect of a rent ceiling, the role of adverse selection in a market, the potential benefits of free trade, or the static welfare effects of monopoly appear to be fairly well understood (at least by social science standards) because economists are in broad agreement, these things are not well-understood in society at large, and economists' views on these issues are generally bourne out empirically.
One of the examples is Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, which is used as a basis for major consensus in the economics profession, and a key driver of the free trade movement, was prepared before the existence of large scale trade data.
the tools to do so were invented by Leontieff in the 60's he and his disciples had all the legitimacy they needed (Turgot, a disciple of Quesnay, eventually become finance Minister) The point I'm trying to make is that lack of mathematical rigor in classical econs does not necessarily mean that they are irrelevant.
Clearly, unskilled worker's work is not worth that much, so at least one of two things must happen now: Skilled worker needs to agree to be paid less or If no skilled worker with x2 efficiency agrees to be paid less then the skilled worker will be replaced with even more skilled worker whose efficiency is higher than x2, so that the employer can maintain the same profit margin.
George Stigler, also reviewing the 1988's Palgrave Dictionary of Economics: Even if one is prepared to concede (as I certainly am not) that this emphasis on Marx and Sraffa is justified by their importance in modern or earlier economics, that would not justify the frequent penetration of Marxian views into the treatment of what are surely non-Marxian subjects.

In the second case, the easiest way to succeed is for consumers with $WTP  P_1$ to tell producers "I'll pay you more than $P_1$ (but still less than my WTP) if you promise you will sell your product to me rather than another consumer", which initiates an upward price-trend.
This would create growth, allowing more doctors and nurses to come through but more importantly create additional bed space.

What exactly is a modified IS-LM framework? Recently in a test I was asked to describe the modified IS-LM framework.
A leftward shift of the supply curve is also an upward shift of the supply curve: Leftward shift: At every price, producers are willing to produce and sell fewer units of the good.
The parking lots would want to get that first row filled up as icing on the cake, then let them sit there through the day as the cars they parked in the accessible ring arrived and left throughout the day.

The GATS covers four modes of supply: (1) cross-border supply; (2) supply through the movement of consumers to the location of the supplier; (3) supply though the establishment in a country of the commercial presence of legal entities from another country; and (4) the supply through natural persons of one country in the territory of another.
As I understand it countries negotiate free trade agreements in services using the WTO GATS.

(I know from S=1, that I can infer that $P_H = P_F$, but I'm confused about whether S=1 is the cause for $P_H = P_F$ or a consequence of $P_H = P_F$).
Clearly, this last formulation has fewer assumptions than my first formulation.

I have looked at the delta method as a possible route but it's too convoluted for me
I'm just wondering if there are specific and well-separated advantages and disadvantages to DSGE relative to BVARs -- for instance as regards certain diagnostic metrics or at certain horizons and certain situations?
Sanford Grossman, Oliver Hart, and John Moore have developed a theory of the firm based on incomplete contracting (Hart was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2016 for this branch of the literature).
The other company in the collaboration didn't think this was technically possible, until they discovered they were wrong.

Therefore, we should also have $ f(k,n_2) = c_2 $ I believe Edit 3 : My profit maximisation gives me : $ \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} n_2 w = k q $ Edit 4 after @X recommendation : So I do the lagrangian and derivatives, which gets me : $ \frac{1}{c_1} = \lambda p_1 $ $ \frac{\beta}{c_2} = \lambda p_2 $ $ \beta = \lambda w $ $ p_1 = q $ After computing, I find : $ c_1 = \frac{p_1 \bar y + w n_2 - \pi}{p_1(1+\beta)} $ and $ x = k = \bar y - c_1 = \frac{\beta p_1 \bar y - w n_2 + \pi}{p_1(1+\beta)} $ But still having trouble regarding my original issue, $ n_2 $ : I did , according to your advices : $ \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} n_2 w = k q $ $ \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} n_2 \frac{\beta}{\lambda} = \frac{\beta p_1 \bar y - w n_2 + \pi}{p_1(1+\beta)} p_1 $ $ \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} n_2 \beta p_1 c_1 = \frac{\beta p_1 \bar y - w n_2 + \pi}{(1+\beta)} $ $ \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} n_2 \frac{\beta}{1+\beta}(p_1 \bar y + w n_2 - \pi) = \frac{\beta p_1 \bar y - w n_2 + \pi}{(1+\beta)} $ $ \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} n_2 \beta(p_1 \bar y + w n_2 - \pi) = \beta p_1 \bar y - w n_2 + \pi $ $ n_2 \beta(p_1 \bar y + w n_2 - \pi) = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} \frac{\beta p_1 \bar y - w n_2 + \pi}{\beta(p_1 \bar y + w n_2 - \pi)} $ Still pretty stupid as results ...
Here is what I have so far: $$k_{t+1}=k_t^\alpha K_t^{1-\alpha}+(1-\delta)k_t-c_t$$ In equilibrium $K_t=k_t$: $$k_{t+1}=k_t+(1-\delta)k_t-c_t$$ $$\implies \frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=1+(1-\delta)-\frac{c_t}{k_t}$$ If we have a constant rate of capital growth, suppose: $$\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}$$ If this is true: $$\underset{t\rightarrow \infty}{lim}\;\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=\underset{t\rightarrow \infty}{lim}\;1+(1-\delta)-\frac{c_t}{k_t}=-\infty$$ This means that the growth rate will continue decreasing.
\;k_{T+1}\geq0$$ Our Lagrangian is: $$\ell(\frac{}{})=\sum_{t=0}^{T}\beta^t\bigg(\frac{((1+1-\delta)k_t-k_{t+1})^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}\bigg)+\lambda k_{T+1}$$ In order to get the transversality condition, we differentiate with respect to $k_{T+1}$ and use the constraint.
\gamma\ln \frac {c_{t+1}}{c_t} = \ln \frac {\lambda_{t}}{\lambda_{t+1}} \tag{1}$$ $$-\beta^t\lambda_tp_t + \beta^{t+1}\lambda_{t+1}(d_{t+1}+p_{t+1})=0 \implies \frac {\lambda_{t}}{\lambda_{t+1}} = \beta \frac{p_{t+1} + d_{t+1}}{p_t} \tag{2}$$ and so, using also the definition of the gross return, $$\ln \frac {\lambda_{t}}{\lambda_{t+1}} = \ln \beta + \ln R_{t+1} \tag{3}$$ Combining $(1)$ and $(3)$ we get $$\ln \frac {c_{t+1}}{c_t} = \frac 1 {\gamma}\ln \beta + \frac 1 {\gamma}\ln R_{t+1} \tag{4}$$ So we see that at the optimal path, consumption growth is a direct affine function of the log-risk returns.
Then the TVC becomes $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\beta^t \big[k_s^*\cdot (1+g)^{t-s}\big]^{1-\gamma}=0$$ Again, shed things that do not depend on $t$, to get $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\beta^t (1+g)^{(1-\gamma)t}=0 \implies \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\big[\beta (1+g)^{(1-\gamma)}\big]^t=0$$ So the TVC will hold if and only if $$\beta (1+g)^{(1-\gamma)} 1$$ In the other question the OP has obtained $$1+g = [\beta(\alpha+1-\delta)]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}$$ Substituting, we want $$\beta \Big([\beta(\alpha+1-\delta)]^{1/\gamma}\Big)^{(1-\gamma)} 1$$ This can be simplified a bit, and it is a restriction on the parameters that must hold in order for the balanced growth path to satisfy the Transversality condition (when $\gamma 1$).
Going to the second term, we have $$d_wB(w) = -kd_wF(w)$$ So $$-A(w)d_wB(w) = d_wF(w) \int_{b_0}^w k[F(w)-F(x)]du(x|F) \tag{3}$$ Therefore $$B(w)d_wA(w) -A(w)d_wB(w) = d_wF(w)\int_{b_0}^w [1+k(1-F(w)]du(x|F) \\+ d_wF(w) \int_{b_0}^w k[F(w)-F(x)]du(x|F)$$ The $d_wF(w)$ is a common factor and the two integrals can be written as one due to linearity, so $$B(w)d_wA(w) -A(w)d_wB(w)=\\ = d_wF(w)\int_{b_0}^w\Big([1+k(1-F(w)] + k[F(w)-F(x)]\Big)du(x|F)$$ The term $kF(w)$ in the integrand cancels off and we are left with $$B(w)d_wA(w) -A(w)d_wB(w) = d_wF(w)\int_{b_0}^w[1+k(1-F(x))]du(x|F)$$ But using the re-arranged $(1)$ and substituting we get $$B(w)d_wA(w) -A(w)d_wB(w) = d_wF(w)\int_{b_0}^wmdH(x)$$ $$= md_wF(w)\cdot \Big(H(x) \big|_{b_0}^w\Big) = md_wF(w)\cdot \Big(H(w) - H(b_0)\Big)$$ But since $H()$ is a CDF in $(b_0, b_1)$, it follows that $H(b_0) =0$.
The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation reads \begin{align} \rho V(x)=\max_u [F(x,u) + V'(x)f(x,u)],\quad \forall t\in[0,\infty) \end{align} Now presume that the feedback control is given by \begin{align} u(x) = \frac{1}{1+V'(x)} = \arg\max_u [F(x,u) + V'(x)f(x,u)],\quad \forall x\in X.
By Girsanov Theorem, $$W_t^{\mathbb Q} \ \text{is standard} \ \mathbb P^{*} \ \text{-Brownian motion, where}$$ $$\frac{d \mathbb P^{*}}{d \mathbb P} := L_T$$ I guess we have that $W_t^{\mathbb Q}$ is standard $\mathbb Q$-Brownian Motion if we can show that $$L_T = \frac{d \mathbb Q}{d \mathbb P}$$ I lost my notes, but I think I was able to show using Ito's lemma that $$dL_t = L_t \xi_t dW_t$$ $$dM_t = M_t \xi_t dW_t$$ From those I infer that $$d(\ln L_t) = d(\ln M_t)$$ $$\to L_t = M_t$$ $$\to L_T = M_T$$ QED Is that right?
I am working on a Solow model where: $$ y_{t} = k_{t}^{\alpha}(Z_{t})^{1-\alpha} $$ $$ y^{*} = (\frac{s}{n+\delta})^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}} Z $$ $$ k^{*} = (\frac{s}{n+\delta})^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} Z $$ I have a question regarding the log-linearization of the following function (per capita capital evolution): $$ k_{t+1} = \frac{1-\delta}{1+n} k_{t} + \frac{s}{1+n}k^{\alpha}(Z_{t})^{1-\alpha} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; (1) $$ I usually apply the following procedure to log-linearize about the steady-state ($k^{*}, Z^{*}$): $$ e^{lnk_{t+1}} = \frac{1-\delta}{1+n}e^{lnk_{t}} + \frac{s}{1+n}(e^{lnk_{t}})^{\alpha}(e^{lnZ_{t}})^{1-\alpha} $$ To get the following approximation: $$ k^{*} + k^{*}(log(k_{t+1}) - log(k^{*}))=k^{*} + k^{*}(log(k_{t}) - log(k^{*}))(\frac{1-\delta}{1+n}) + k^{*}Z^{*} + k^{*}Z^{*}(log(k_{t}) - log(k^{*}))(\alpha)(\frac{s}{1+n}) + k^{*}Z^{*}(log(Z_{t}) - log(Z^{*}))(1-\alpha)(\frac{s}{1-n}) $$ $$ \Rightarrow k^{*} + k^{*} \hat{k}_{t}= k^{*} + k^{*}\hat{k}_{t}(\frac{1-\delta}{1+n}) + k^{*}Z^{*} + k^{*}Z^{*}\hat{k}_{t}(\alpha)(\frac{s}{1+n}) + k^{*}Z^{*}\hat{Z}_{t}(1-\alpha)(\frac{s}{1-n}) $$ $$ \hat{k}_{t} = \hat{k}_{t}[\frac{1-\delta}{1+n} + \frac{s}{1+n}\alpha] + (1-\alpha) \frac{s}{1+n} \hat{Z}_{t} $$ The answer provided my my professor is: $$ \hat{k}_{t} = \hat{k}_{t}[\frac{1-\delta}{1+n} + (\frac{n + \delta}{s})\frac{s}{1+n}\alpha] + (\frac{n + \delta}{s})(1-\alpha) \frac{s}{1+n} \hat{Z}_{t} $$ where $ \frac{n + \delta}{s} = \frac{y^{*}}{k^{*}} $ Now if anyone can point out to me the mistake I am making I would greatly appreciate it.

Car prices haven’t gone up due to the majority of auto makers profits being from the truck and SUV market.
) Question I hope I did not over-simplify the matter, and I would like to understand what is the regulation the article refers to and what is the logic behind the perceived "more prone to volatility?"
Therefore, it might be a case that it is more efficient (or profitable) to take on board more fuel (even if it means that the plane will burn more fuel) than to buy fuel for a higher price, i.e.
And that frankly is being kind by not mentioning a lot of the stuff "out there" that nonetheless influences some politicians, e.g.
As the BBC describes it: "planes are filled with extra fuel, usually to avoid paying higher prices for refuelling at destination airports".

If $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} $ is twice continuously differentiable, has a non-negative gradient, and is supermodular, and $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is twice continuously differentiable and convex, then $g(f(x))$ is increasing and supermodular To show increasing I think we can just show $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} g(f(x))  0$ $$ \displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} g(f(x) = g'(f(x)) f'(x) $$ Since $f(x)$ has a non-negative gradient $f'(x) \geq 0$, but I'm not sure how to show $g'(f(x))  0$ as given convex tells us $g''(x)  0$ For supermodularity, let $l, l' \in \mathbb{R}^n$; $g(f(x))$ will be supermodular if the following inequality holds: $$ \displaystyle (g \circ f)(l \vee l') + (g \circ f)(l \wedge l') \geq (g \circ f)(l) + (g \circ f)(l') $$ I think if we had $l_i \leq l_i', \; \forall i$, then we will have equality as $(g \circ f)(l \vee l') = (g \circ f)(l') $ and $ (g \circ f)(l \wedge l') = (g \circ f)(l)$, but don't know what to do for the other cases.
The value of $h(g(f(u(x,y))$ is not necessarily positive but the transformation $u \rightarrow h \circ g \circ f \circ u$ is indeed a positive monotone transformation.

So trivially, $${\rm tr}\Big[(x_n-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1} (x_n-\mu)\Big] = (x_n-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1} (x_n-\mu) $$ But since also, from the mentioned property of the trace, $${\rm tr}\Big[(x_n-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1} (x_n-\mu)\Big] = {\rm tr}\Big[\Sigma^{-1} (x_n-\mu)(x_n-\mu)^T\Big]$$ combining one gets the alternative expression for the mutlivariate normal log-likelihood.

What exactly is the difference between Euclidean space,vector space ,metric space ,commodity space,Cartesian space?
whereas, if the mechanism is ex-ante it means we only anticipate that it is budget balanced?
I think they refer to duality of vector spaces. e, the commodity space is a vector space, a price system is a linear functional over the commodity space (assigning a value to each bundle), and so the space of all possible price systems is the dual of the commodity space.

In Oilonia the currency is oilinos and the main moneychanger is Bancoilio. "Could we borrow the 4 million oilinos?
However, if the government takes away from the market 1,000 tonnes, then the supply curve will shift left by that amount, resulting in a new equilibrium with 4,000tonnes @ \$2.
the two money changers would not sell currency out of their inventory at all, but would only do the deal so far as they could lay it off immediately.
50 per tonne. Some possibilities: (1) farm owners lack the capital to buy mechanical harvesters (2) human labor is cheaper (3) regulatory or legal obstacles are blocking the use of harvesters
In the case, does the 8133 tonnes gold reserves in US include the gold liability to other countries?
The aggregation of this sort of situation over many households can explain the coexistence of poverty and saving on a significant scale.
Which means we devote more and more to services... But as farm productivity increases more, we eat the same, but it costs less and less to produce it, so we devote less and less of or budget to it.
But 'ill add that given that we live on a world economy and the price of gold is fixed by international exchanges betweeen coutries a theoritical calculation of the real price involves currency exchanges and more theory.
If the investors are abroad, they would be less affected by a slow down or a crash or the economy, and thus ask for higher prices to compensate for the risk of defaults.
And there's broader literature on industrial policy and regulation too. Frank Geels of Manchester does a lot of work on the theoretical side of this.

In this example, we can think of cheese (x) and crackers (y) as perfect complements, but cheese will be a perfect substitute for a cracker and cheese sandwich.
By linearity of the payoff function you have, $\forall s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$: $$ \pi(\sigma_i',s_{-i})=p_{s_i}\pi(s_i',s_{-i}) + (1-p_{s_i})\pi(\Lambda_i,s_{-i})  p_{s_i}\pi(s_i,s_{-i}) + (1-p_{s_i})\pi(\Lambda_i,s_{-i}) = \pi(\sigma_i,s_{-i}) $$ where $\Lambda_i$, loosely speaking, denotes the residual combination of strategies played in $\sigma_i$, apart from $s_i$, inherited by $\sigma_i'$ too.
for $s_i, s_i' \in S_i$ $$u_i(s_i \vee s_i', s_{-i})+u_i(s_i \wedge s_i', s_{-i}) \geq u_i(s_i , s_{-i})+u_i(s_i', s_{-i})$$ Or For $i \in I$, $u_i$ is upper-semicontinuous, i.e.
Player $i$'s payoff function is: $v_i(s_i,s_{j})=$ $-s_i$ if $s_is_{j}$ ($\frac{1}{2}-s_i$) if $s_i=s_{j}$ ($1-s_i$) if $s_is_j$.
This seems that we distinguish $\sigma_i^2$ from $\hat{e}_i^2$. Does this imply that $\sigma_i^2$(the sample variance) is equal to $\hat{e}_i^2$?
Where can I get info on dairy products like cream cheese? I would like to know the market commodity price of cream cheese.
Then by definition, $$ u_i(s_i^*,s_{-i})u_i(s_i,s_{-i}) $$ for all $i$, all $s_i\ne s_i^*$ and all $s_{-i}$.
But then $$\sum_{i=1}^A \frac {S_i(t)}{C(t)} =1 $$ and (I presume), $S_i(t) \geq 0,\; \forall i$.
Then the supposed inequality can be written as $$\frac {\partial L^s_i(w)/\partial w}{L^s_i(w)}\cdot w  \frac {\sum_{i=1}^n\partial L^s_i(w)/\partial w}{\sum_{i=1}^n L^s_i(w)} \cdot w,\;\;\; \forall i$$ Simplify and rearrange $$\frac {\partial L^s_i(w)/\partial w}{\sum_{i=1}^n\partial L^s_i(w)/\partial w}  \frac {L^s_i(w)}{\sum_{i=1}^n L^s_i(w)} \;\;\;\forall i$$ But this cannot hold, because the left side as well as the right side both sum up to unity over $n$.
Pure strategy $s_i^*\in S_i$ is weakly dominant for player $i$ if every other strategy $s_i\in S_i\setminus\{s_i^*\}$ is weakly dominated by $s_i^*$.

dealer, tau_, gambling, db, θ_, rf, tractor, da, h_u, car
So knowing $GDPc = \frac{GDP}{pop}$ you can write: $$ \tau_{GDPc} = \frac{\frac{GDP(t)}{pop(t)} - \frac{GDP(t-1)}{pop(t-1)}}{ \frac{GDP(t-1)}{pop(t-1)}}$$ With the definition of the rate of change, you write $$pop(t)= pop(t-1)*(\tau_{pop}+1) $$ You can then simplify the $pop(t-1)$ term in the previous equation and you get $$\tau_{GDPc} = \frac{1}{\tau_{pop}+1}\left[\frac{GDP(t)-GDP(t-1)}{GDP(t-1)}-\tau_{pop}\right] $$ $$\tau_{GDPc} = \frac{1}{\tau_{pop}+1}\left[\tau_{GDP}-\tau_{pop}\right]$$ It is indeed different than Brandon marcus answer.
Also note how the input of unskilled labor in the manufacturing sector has been replaced by $H_u^m=H_u-H_u^f$, that is to say, the manufacturing sector uses all the unskilled labor that is left over from the farming sector (we assume that the stock of unskilled labor ($H_u$) is fixed for the period of study).

I assume the following ranking $θ_1  θ_2  θ_3$. If I assume all IC's and PC's bind in equilibrium ($=$ instead of $\geq$), then I get $θ_1 = θ_2$.
In that case the decision of the individual to use online gambling rather than conventional gambling has an unintended effect on the production possibilities for the government.
By the maximum principle optimality requires that the Hamiltonian \begin{align} H_1(k,\tau_1,\tau_2^*,\lambda_1) := F(k,\tau_1,\tau_2^*) + \lambda_1 f(k,\tau_1,\tau_2^*) \end{align} is concave in $(k,\tau_1,\tau_2)$ (sufficient condition).
So the total tax rate on capital is $$\tau_c = \tau_d+\tau_{\pi}-\tau_d\tau_{\pi}$$ In your case $\tau_d\tau_{\pi} = 0.
Lets imagine a hypothetical scenario where you buy a capital good of a tractor.
I was thinking about how online gambling could cause numerous governments to face a reduction in tax revenue from conventional gambling, upon which taxes do apply in most countries.

p_x, p_y, l_, r, frac, omega, refugee, c, p_z, change
Suppose we have two goods, price changes in the two are independent; having seen this question I am considering why the change in total Consumer Surplus is the sum of the change in Consumer Surplus for the two goods separately (if this is true)?
I get that the Hicksian and Marshallian demand functions are $x^* = \frac{p_y}{p_x} y = \frac{I}{2 p_x} $ respectively.
Now suppose I increase $p_x$ to $p_x'$. Suppose I have the utility function $$U(x,y) = \sqrt{x} + y$$ subject to budget constraint $$p_x x + p_y y = m$$ Then $$x_M =\frac{p_y^2}{4 p_x^2}$$ $$y_M = \frac{m}{p_y} - \frac{p_y}{4 p_x}$$ where $M$ denotes Marshallian.
He exhausts his wealth (his endowment): $4 p_x + 1 p_y = w = x_d p_x + y_d p_y$ We can use this to solve for $y_d = (4 p_x + 1 p_y) / (p_y + 2 p_x)$ (eqn 1) and $x_d = 2 (4 p_x + 1 p_y) / (p_y + 2 p_x)$ (eqn 2).
Imagine I have a continuum of different goods indexed by $\omega \in [0,1]$. That is, defining $$U(C) = \int_{0}^1 C(\omega) \delta_{\omega} d\omega$$ where $\delta(\omega)$ is a ``function'' which is equal to $+\infty$ at $\omega$ and $0$ everywhere else.
1p_y}-\frac{p_x}{p_y}x \end{equation} where the relative price is still $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$.
Suppose, price of $x$ is $p_x$; price of $y$ is $p_y$ . So, the income of the consumer = $10 p_y$ And the corresponding budget constraint will be: $x p_x + y p_y = 10p_y$ Vertical intercept $(0, y) = (0,10)$ and horizontal intercept $(x, 0) = \left( \displaystyle\frac{10p_y}{p_x}, 0\right)$ Now suppose $p_y$ is increased to $p_y'$.
(Changes in) Hicksian demand is related to the substitution effect from the Slutsky decomposition.
Suppose I have a Marshallian demand function $x_M(p_x^0,p_y,m^0)$. As I understand it, Slutsky compensation is defined as $$T_S = \Delta p_x \cdot x_M(p_x^0,p_y,m^0)$$ Can someone explain why this compensation overcompensates the consumer?
How do I derive the demand function from $$U=y + 2\sqrt{x}$$ Currently I have $MRS = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$, so, $P_y = P_x\sqrt{x}$ Using the budget line: $$I = xP_x + yP_y \implies I = xP_x +y(P_x\sqrt{x})$$ Which simplifies to $$x = \frac{2I + y^2 P_x \pm y\sqrt{Px(4I+y^2P_x)}}{2P_x}$$ I'm not sure if this is correct, should I have did $MRS = \frac{1}{\sqrt {x}} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$, so, $P_x = \frac{P_y}{\sqrt{x}}$ instead and substitute $\frac{P_y}{\sqrt{x}}$ into budget line?

These functions are deterministic algorithms that produce numbers that can pass for random.
For some outcomes random effects are supported, for others fixed are. For the main table of results in my paper would it be acceptable to report the results of the fixed effects models for those outcomes that the Hausman suggests should use a fixed effects estimator and the results of the random effects estimator for those outcomes that a random effects estimator is suggested for?
So if markets can make mistakes, but not in a way that allows anyone to make disproportionate rewards except by random chance, then they can be highly efficient.

The treausury accepts the competitive bids in ascending order of yield until the accepted bid reaches the offering amount.
Existing user-written commands (adocomp, shapley, shapley2 or DSAP package) are quit limited as they only decompose specific poverty measures offered by those packages.
We know that Elasticity of Demand Coefficient = Change in Quantity Demanded / Change in Price $x$ If we change price by $x$, how do we get what the change in quantity demanded is if there is no quantity demanded at the new price?
Management sets the quantity of ressources and intermediate goods the striking employees have at their disposal to use as inputs.
Hence, for any change in quantity, $\% \Delta P=0$. $$\epsilon_D=\frac{\% \Delta Q_D}{\% \Delta P}$$ A perfectly elastic demand curve is horizontal, meaning we quantity demanded can change by any amount without changing price (any quantity can be sold at the price corresponding the vertical intercept).
When a change in price results in an infinitely large response in quantity demanded, demand is perfectly elastic.
5, the percentage change in quantity demanded is half the percentage change in price.
This is the same as saying that the market price changes by $dP$ and is why you get the same number.

I don't really see why you would price an ETF at fair value and not at last market price, given that those funds are very liquid.
The mutual funds are worth less than liquidation value because the managers of the fund are in a position to block the liquidation and have an incentive to do so in order to protect their fees.

Pick any set of non-negative $p_1,\dots,p_n$ such that $p_1+\cdots+p_n=1$. The convex combination of degenerate lotteries $L^1,\dots,L^n$ with the $p_i$'s can be written as \begin{align} p_1L^1+\cdots+p_nL^n=p_1(1,0,\dots,0)+\cdots+p_n(0,\dots,0,1)\\ =\bigl(p_1(1)+p_2(0)+\cdots+p_n(0),\;\dots,\;p_1(0)+\cdots+p_{n-1}(0)+p_n(1)\bigr)\\ =(p_1,\dots,p_n).
So each lottery $L_i=(p_i,1-p_i)$ is a distribution over the two payoffs, where $p_i$ is the probability that you get $\$1$ and $1-p_i$ is the probability of getting $\$0$.

The inter temporal elasticity of substitution between two periods of time is $$\sigma=-\frac{d[\ln(c(s)/c(t))]}{d[\ln(U'(c(s))/U'(c(t)))]}$$ I need to prove that $$\lim_{s \to t}\sigma = -\frac{U'(c(t))}{U''(c(t))c(t)}$$ So, I have the following by the definition of total differential: $$\sigma=-\frac{ \frac{dc(s)}{c(s)}-\frac{dc(t)}{c(t)}}{ \frac{U''(c(s))}{U'(c(s)}dc(s)- \frac{U''(c(t))}{U'(c(t)}dc(t) }$$ Then if $s$ tends to $t$ we have an indetermination $0/0$ so, we use L'Hôpital Rule.
It stressed economic freedom and promoted ideas such as laissez-faire and free competition.

I’ve been trying to think of social welfare functionals which meet all of Arrow’s conditions–––unrestricted domain, weak Pareto, independence of irrelevant utilities, and non-dictatorship (see this entry for definitions)–––plus (invariance with regard to) absolute-scale full-comparability (AFC).
WARP/SARP differ from GARP in that the former presumes the availability of infinitely many choice data to build a choice function with, whereas GARP only requires a finite set of choice data.
For instance, if $()$ is a linear expected utility function representing a vNM-consistent preference, then $()=[()]^2$ is another utility function representing the same preference, except that it is a non-linear (or non-vNM) expected utility function.
Suppose there are two agents $\{A,B\}$ with the following utility functions: $U_A(x_A,y_A)=x_A+f(y_A)$ and $U_B(x_B,y_B)=x_B+g(y_B)$ $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing and strictly concave.
Jonathan Levin in "Choice under Uncertainty" wrote in Theorem 1 " A complete and transitive preference relation on a set of lotteries P satisfies continuity and independence if and only if it admits as expected utility representation".
Allocation in which A consumes everything and B consumes nothing: $(x_A, y_A) = (1,1)$ and $(x_B, y_B) = (0,0)$ is Pareto efficient, but $y_A \neq y_B$.

For portfolio (1), $$ r_i - r_f - b(r_m - r_f) = r_i + (b-1) r_f - b r_m $$ and for portfolios (2) $$ r_i - b r_m - (1-b) r_f = r_i + (b-1) r_f - b r_m.
Usually for CAPM we have: $$E(R_i)-\gamma=\frac{cov(R_i,R_m)}{var(R_m)}\times E(R_m-\gamma)$$ We know that $$\beta=\frac{cov(R_i,R_m)}{var(R_m)}$$ When can we replace $\beta$ with $\left(\frac{E(R_iR_m)}{E(R_m)}\right)^2$ ?
In particular, BDS provides information on Establishment openings and closings and Number of startups and firm shutdowns.
Singer would have a disutility of $1$. If Singer buys humane meat then Foreman would do so too if $V-C'v-c$ (which may be possible since $C'C$).
I run the following regression: $$r_i-r_f=a+b(r_m-r_f)+e $$ Now I see that the alpha is not zero and I construct two different zero cost portfolios: 1) 100% long in ($r_i-r_f$) and -b short in ($r_m-r_f$) 2) 100% long in $r_i$ -b short in r_m and borrow/short (1-b) on$ r_f$ I have problems determining the expected returns of the two portfolios and determining if they are the same.
The architect writes to the builder suggesting that the profits be divided equally.
These factors are in general not likely to be pecuniary, so they are usually treated as a residual - if MW/COL in state A is less than MW/COL in state B, then the difference must be due to improved amenities in state A.
As you may already know, we can either regress the $(2)$ if we are interested on both $α_i$ and $β_i$ or alternatively we just use the formula $β_i=Cov(R_i,R_m)/Var(R_m)$, because $α$ should be close to zero (transaction costs).

As "Eco-meat-eater" you do vote with your wallet and maybe convince your grocery store to add more environmentally friendly meat to its assortment.
Singer is a consequentialist and has as a goal to reduce the meat consumption. Foreman enjoys meat but he prefers humane meat (other things equal).
So, I have heard non-meat eaters claim they make the most impact by not supporting the meat industry at all.
Possibly, abundance could be available soon along these lines: organic food - abundance of edible insects and clean meat from meat breweries housing - abundant through abandoned rural areas and 3D printed homes, water and good air possible available there as well education - given you are okay with self-education Internet provides enough free/cheap learning resources

In the model there is no depreciation so, $$ g_c = \frac 1{\theta}[r - \rho - \theta g_x] $$ $$\dot {\hat k} = f(\hat k) - \hat c - (n+g_x)\hat k$$ At steady state growth of $\hat k$ and $\hat c$ are both $0$.
Moreover, evidently $\frac {\partial \hat k^*}{\partial g_x} 0$ so in all $$\frac {\partial \hat c^*}{\partial g_x} 0$$ Therefore, if $g_x \downarrow \implies \hat c^* \uparrow $.
So, by construction, $$X\hat{\beta}+\hat{e}=X\hat{\beta}+y-X\hat{\beta}=y$$. We are replacing $y$ with $\hat{y}+\hat{e}$, which is the fitted value of $y$, given by $X\hat{\beta}$, plus the estimated value of the residual, given by $y-X\hat{\beta}$.

I supposed it was to make things easier, so I checked it: 1 EUR = 1,3280 CAD (2) = 1,3280 CAD = 1 EUR 1 CAD = 0,6691 EUR (3) 1,3280 * 1 CAD = 1,3280 * 0,6691 EUR = 1,3280 CAD = 0.
The interface was similar to this: Action: [ ] Buy [ ] Sell Currency: [ ] CAD [ ] USD So basically, in order to do what I wanted to do (convert CAD to USD), I had 2 options: A) Buy USD B) Sell CAD What's the difference between both actions ?
The jobs gained by recycling are lost from other sectors and the jobs lost are gained.
The wikipedia article about Homothetic preferences however defined a preference to be homothetic, if they can be represented by a utility function and the following is true: $$ u(kx_1, kx_2) = k \cdot u(x_1, x_2)$$ And I am pretty sure, that this is not true for Cobb Douglas preferences: $$ u(kx_1, kx_2) = (kx_1)^a (kx_2)^b = k^{a+b} x_1^a x_2^b \neq k \cdot u(x_1, x_2)$$ So what am I missing here?

q_, firm, q_i, pi_, p_, response, best, profit, dq_, cournot
Then, you solve Firm 1's profit maximization, with Firm 1 correctly anticipating the responses of the subsequent two firms: \begin{equation} \max_{q_1}\; \bigl(16-q_1-q_2^*(q_1)-q_3^*(q_1,q_2)\bigr)q_1.
Let $\pi_1(q_1, q_2), \pi_2(q_1, q_2)$ denotes firm 1's profit and firm 2's profit respectively when firm 1 produces $q_1$ and firm 2 produces $q_2$.
For $j = n$ the best response is given by \begin{align} b_n(Q_{n-1}) = \arg\max_{q_n}(1 - Q_{n-1} - q_n)q_n = \frac{1- Q_{n-1}}{2}.
Likewise, from $(2)$ we get Firm 2's best response to Firm 1's output, $q_2^*(q_1)$.
Case 2: signaling exist Consider the firm 2 $$\pi_2 = max [ (a-q_2-q_1)q_1]$$ By FOC, $q_2=(1/2)[a-q_1]$ Now consider the firm 1, $$\pi_1= max [ (1/2)(ah-q_1^H-q_2)q_1^H+(1/2)(aL-q_1^L-q_2)q_1^L]$$ S.t.
Let me call it $\pi_1(q_1,q_2)=TR-TC=p\cdot q_1-c\cdot q_1$ for firm 1 and $\pi_2(q_1,q_2)=TR-TC=p\cdot q_2-c\cdot q_2$ for firm 2, then to check that P is the potential of this game you want to check that $\frac{\partial P(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_1}=\frac{\partial \pi_1(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_1}$ and that $\frac{\partial P(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_2}=\frac{\partial \pi_2(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_2}$.
For firm 1, $$\pi_1=max[(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_1-cq_1]$$ FOCs for $q_1$ $$a-2bq_1-bq_2-c=0$$ So $$q_1={a-bq_2-c\over 2b}$$ For firm 2, $$max [(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_2]$$ FOCs $$a-bq_1-2bq_2=0$$ $$q_2={a-bq_1\over 2b}$$ So, $$q_1={a-b({a-bq_1\over 2b})-c\over 2b}$$ $$q_1^*={a-2c\over 3b}$$ And $$q^*_2={5a+2b\over 6b}$$ —- The question says that “* firm 1 maximizes profit and firm 2 maximizes revenue as long as shareholders are satisfied, which he achieves by keeping profits nonnegative.
Incumbent firms face a production cost of $C_i (q_i) = 4q_i$ for $i= 1,2$. All firms face a market price of $P(Q) = 16-q_1-q_2-q_3$.
This is because when $q_2  q_1$, $p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)(q_2 - q_1)  0$ and $c'(q_2) - c'(q_1)  0$, when $q_2  q_1$, $p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)(q_2 - q_1)  0$ and $c'(q_2) - c'(q_1)  0$.
The demand is $p(q) = A − Bq$. My Workings I've tried to solve the problem using the following method: Leader ($q_1$) $$\begin{align} profit(q_1,q_2,q_3) = (A - B(q_1+q_2+q_3))q_1 -cq_1 -F \\  = Aq_1 - B(q_1+q_2+q_3)q_1 -cq_1 -F\\  = Aq_1 - Bq_1^2 - Bq_2q_1 - Bq_3q_1 - cq_1 -F\end{align}$$ The I took the derivative in regards to $q_1$ leaving me with this: $$profit(q_1,q_2,q_3)= A - 2Bq_1 - Bq_2 -Bq_3 -c$$ Finally I just tried finding $q_1$: $$q_1 = \frac{A-C-Bq_2-Bq_3}{2B}$$ To put $q_1$ into the equation and solve it for $q_2$ and then $q_3$ The Problem: The begining of the solution in the answer sheet looks like this: Solution For Stackelberg with two followers, after firm 1 made its move, agents 2 and 3 are making their move simultaneously knowing q1.

It doesn't seem to me that there were any substantive differences between the Bretton Woods regime and the gold standard, as seen in the early 1970s, when Richard Nixon was forced to remove the US Dollar from its gold peg.
I was travelling recently and realised that dollars, euros, British pounds and Swiss francs all have more or less the same worth (i.e.
Think of this as a taste for variety: if I'm indifferent between 2 can of pop and 2 slices of pizza, then I will be strictly better off if I get a combo of 1 pop and 1 pizza than having only one of the goods.
The Bureau of Statistics in the Department of Commerce and Labor was created out of the Bureau of Foreign Commerce (housed in the Department of State), and the Bureau of Statistics (housed in the Department of the Treasury).
The Swiss Central Bank has a monopoly over the issue / production of Swiss francs.
The last piece of advice I can give you - try to draw as many graphs as you can think of and then try to find a story that the graph is explaining.
But my question was before this the Swiss Franc was pegged against the euro. So how is it the you could have place a bet the euro would rise against the swiss franc when the Swiss Franc was pegged against the euro .
It is "convex to the origin" in the sense that if we "stand" at the origin, the point $(0,0)$, and "look towards" the graph, we will perceive it as convex.
2 CHF : 1 EUR. Strictly speaking it was not a peg but a cap: the Swiss National Bank said it would sell unlimited Swiss Francs at the rate of 1.

Indeed, the KKT conditions (i) and (ii) cannot be necessary---because, we know (either by Weierstrass, or just by inspection as you have done) a solution to $(*)$ exists while (i) and (ii) has no solution in $\{ g \leq 0 \}$.
I am looking for an overview as most of the introduction to matching talks about the work done in the Marriage market, Job Matching which is axiomatic.
But that's not a global warming problem, they will happily build coal plants all day long.
I am skeptical about claims against its effectiveness. I understand this question has political connotations, and that there are claims of obfuscation and misunderstanding from both command and market camps, but I am asking for the most perspicacious and academic assessment of the performance of the Soviet command economy.

Personally, I would call this block-jacknife or leave-one-block-out cross validation.
Well done for spotting this one. Then the maximum of this expression is the maximum of $-C$ (Cost) which is equivalent to the minimum of $C$, and the equivalence with maximum profit holds under duality.
Are there necessary conditions for the existence of an equilibrium? I got that in an exchange economy, conditions as preferences being continuous, strictly convex and strongly monotone and $\sum_i \omega_i\gg 0$ are sufficient conditions for the existence of a Walrasian (or competitive) equlibirum.

5kg}{kWh} \approx 277\frac{kg}{tx}$ If the whole energy used for bitcoin was produced in germany one bitcoin transaction would have a carbon footprint of 277kg.
More generally, what is required of a numeraire? Real aggregate demand is $$ C = \left(\sum_j c_j^{(\eta-1)/\eta}\right)^{\eta/(\eta-1)} $$ and labor supply is inelastic, so the budget constraint is $ \sum_j p_j c_j = W $ and the demand function is $$ c_j^{*} = \frac{C P^{\eta}}{p_j^{\eta}} $$ where $$ P = \left(\sum_j p_j^{1-\eta} \right)^{1/(1-\eta)} $$ is the ideal price index.
(2) Another reason that movie tickets might get more expensive is because everything gets more expensive together.
it is a harmonic perturbation) with an angular frequency $ω$, the transition is into states with energies that differ by $ħω$ from the energy of the initial state.
The former is possible for a farm in a cool climate, where perhaps crop B was previously too unreliable, but with a higher average temperature becomes more profitable than crop A.
The "numeraire" should now be $C' (P')^{\eta} = \lambda^{\eta}$, hence prices relative to the new "numeraire" should now be $p_j' = p_j \lambda^{1-\eta}$, not $\lambda p_j$.
The demand function for theater tickets is $D_t(p_t,p_c)$, where $p_t$ stands for the price of theater tickets and $p_c$ stands for the price of cinema tickets.
Some theaters earn more money from snacks sales than the movies. In general, the theater will make money with big box movies only after a few weeks, and gives more profit than LB movies because the amount of tickets sold are much higher.
Edit: Price of energy refers to the price of energy carrier, say oil. I have time series data on energy service prices (not energy prices), which I am thinking of using as a proxy for energy saving technologies.
So why do some states ban scalping tickets? Strangely enough, why tickets? IMHO, scalping tickets is no different from legitimate arbitrage unless manipulative.

If we consider the definition of a Nash Equilibrium,and carefully consider the strategy sets for each player, we can see there are at least 10 Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria: $$(s_1^*,s_2^*) \in \{(0,8),(1,7),(2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,1),(7,1),(8,0),(8,8-s_1)\}.

2): perfect information here is modeled as a player function $P$ mapping each non-terminal history to a set of players, where [a] history in such a game is a sequence of vectors; the components of each vector $a^k$ are the actions taken by the players whose turn it is to move after the history $(a^\ell)_{\ell=1}^{k-1}$.
It just sounds odd that all along, Harsanyi allows a player's type to be unknown only to other players, but in the end, no matter what, whether you have various types or not, the payoffs must be computed in expectation.
Game trees are a great tool to present dynamic games such as standard sequential-move games with perfect and complete information (player 1 moves first, player 2 observes the move and reacts, and so on), and they can also be used to present games of incomplete information or games of imperfect information.
By randomizing the payoff will be higher, but it will also be the case that with positive probability $y\neq x\neq x'$, since the behavior of all players is stochastically independent.

Consider the stage game in the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma game: The goal is to derive conditions on $\delta$ such that the symmetric tit-for-tat strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium.
Since Player 2's beliefs have changed with respect to game 1, the mixed strategy given by $G$ is, in general, no longer optimal (unless $a$ and $b$ give the same payoff regardless of the action of player 1).

They also find that dropping the wealth taxes didn't change this pattern, however, they attribute this to an "equalizing force": One important confounding reason why wealth inequality has stabilized in Denmark (despite wealth tax cuts) is likely to be the sharp rise of pension wealth, from around 50% of national income in the late 1980s to 178% in 2014.
A major concern is also that a substantial share of the private wealth of the top 1% is invested in productive firms which employ millions of people.
That's why there's an "I" in "IRS": they're the Internal Revenue Service, as opposed to Customs, which collects taxes on external products.
Stamp duty brackets used to be absolute rates: so when the purchase price crossed over the bracket threshold by £1, the marginal rate would be huge, as the whole purchase price was taxed in the higher rate.
However, the personal tax allowance is clawed back at incomes above £100,000 at a 50% rate, so those with incomes above £122,000 don't benefit from the allowance at all.
Exploiting recurring variation in household liquidity, this study shows that when low-income households have more liquidity, they partially catch up to higher-income households’ ability to use intertemporal savings strategies.
Conceptually, as compared to a neutral taxation scheme, a progressive one shifts the tax burden more towards the higher segments of the income distribution, and a regressive one shifts the tax burden more towards the lower segments.
So, to put it succinctly: Denmark has a public policy of taxing high earners in order to subsidize those at the lower end, while public and private pensions (which tend to be much larger than in other developed nations) are of primary benefit to the high earners.
It will vary in value because trust in it will fluctuate just as trust in facebook fluctuates.

homothetic, psi_u, matched, nu, nu_s, twice, seller, forall, au, ay
Here's another way, using the same notation as Adam, to get to the same result: $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = P(\text{searching twice | being matched})\cdot P(\text{another match | searching twice}) $$ Now, $$P(\text{searching twice | being matched}) = \frac{P(\text{searching twice and being matched})}{P(\text{being matched})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s} $$ $$P(\text{another match | searching twice}) = \frac{P(\text{another match and searching twice})}{P(\text{searching twice})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} $$ So, $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s}\frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} = \frac{2\psi_u\nu}{(1+\psi_u)}$$
Are there any works covering this property? A Homothetic Utility is where $$ \forall x,y, \forall a \in \mathbb{R}_+: \ u(ax,ay)=au(x,y) $$ (or its monotonic transformation).
Pages 7,8: Unemployed search once or twice (for a seller). $\psi_u$:probability of searching twice, searching once with prob $1-\psi_u$ $\nu$ is the probability of finding a seller.
The probability that a buyer is matched with $s$ and (either before or after) another seller is then (assuming that $\nu_s$ is small so that the probability of finding $s$ twice in at most 2 searches can be ignored): $$\psi_u(\nu_s\nu+\nu\nu_s)= 2\psi_u\nu_s\nu$$ The probability that a buyer is matched with $s$ via either a single or a double search is (again ignoring the probability, given a double search, of finding $s$ twice): $$(1-\psi_u)\nu_s + \psi_u(\nu_s + \nu_s)=\nu_s(1+\psi_u)$$ The conditional probability of a buyer being matched with $s$ and another seller, conditional on $s$ being matched with that buyer, is therefore: $$\frac{2\psi_u\nu_s\nu}{\nu_s(1+\psi_u)}=\frac{2\psi_u\nu}{1+\psi_u}$$ But the latter formula does not depend on $\nu_s$.
Obviously, if a utility function on a set of consumption bundles is homothetic, then the preference relation is homothetic.
The total number of matched applications is $$\sum_{x=1}^\infty g(x)xv = E[x]v$$ The number of applications matched with vacancies with $x$-many applications is $$g(x)xv$$ Hence $$Prob(\text{matching with x} | \text{matched} = \frac{g(x)x}{E[x]}$$ Using this in the equation in the question gives $$ \tilde f = a \sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{g(x)x}{E[x]}\frac{1}{x}\\ = E[x]a \sum_{x=1}^\infty g(x) \\ = \frac{v}{u} (1-g(0)) = f $$
Hot dog vendors: some of the ticket buyers would have bought more from the vendors had they not paid the extra $5, so that cost fell on the vendors too.
8 represent homothetic preferences? I understand what homothetic preferences are in theory, but I don't know how to calculate if a utility function represents homothetic preferences.
Can someone give an example of what exactly is not a homothetic preference so I understand what is?
Also is it possible to have inferior inputs with homothetic technology? Can someone suggest a good resource on homothetic technologies and what properties they imply about cost function, profit function, input demands, output supply etc?

Trump’s economic proposals are adopted. Some Moody analysts predicted in mid-2016 a Trump recession starting in 2018 of varying intensities depending on how much of Trump's policies got implemented: the economy will be significantly weaker if Mr.
(1) Most of Trump's proposed policies have been implemented only to a limited extent or not at all.
Recall that if $t_j$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,x]$, then the probability that $t_j \in [a,b]$, where $0 \leq a \leq b \leq x$ is given by $$ \Pr ( a \leq t_j \leq b) = \int_a^b p_i (t_j) d t_j $$ In particular, $$ \Pr (t_j = a) = 0 $$ for any $a$.
It then goes on to say that if $t_j$ is presumed to be uniformly distributed on $[0,x]$, then $p_i(t_j) = 1/x$ for all $t_j$.

$$1-c_2-2c_1c_2+c_2^2=0\\-1-c_1+2c_2-c_1^2+2c_1c_2=0$$ Adding the equations shows that $(c_2-c_1)(1+c_1+c_2)=0$, which is only possible if $c_1=c_2$.

Consider two consumption profiles $(c_1 , c_2 )$ and $(c_1^′ , c^′_2 )$, where $c_1 + c_2 = c^′_1 + c^′_2$.
In the second part you have $U(C_2 (C_1) )$, i.e. You take the derivative of U with respect to $C_1$, which equals: $d U/d C_1 = \partial U(C_2)/ \partial C_2 * d C_2 / d C_1$.
Multiply one of the expressions by $-1$ on each side: $$p_1 c_1^F - p_2 c_2^F = 0$$ $$-p_1 c_1^H + p_2 c_2^H = 0$$ And set each expression equal to each other: $$p_1 c_1^F - p_2 c_2^F = -p_1 c_1^H + p_2 c_2^H$$ Put the $p_1$ and $p_2$ terms together: $$p_1 c_1^F + p_1 c_1^H = p_2 c_2^F + p_2 c_2^H$$ Factor the $p_1$ and $p_2$ terms and rearrange: $$p_1 (c_1^F + c_1^H) = p_2 (c_2^F + c_2^H) \implies \frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{c_2^F + c_2^H}{c_1^F+ c_1^H}$$

Considering these I think the strategy set of $i$ is $$ S_i={\sf X}^{T-1}_{t=0} A_i^{A^t}.
I think one can make a reasonable argument that going from 1 bedroom (small house) to 2 bedrooms should have a larger impact on the price than going from say 5 bedrooms (large house) to 6 bedrooms because the marginal value of adding an extra bedroom is larger in that case.
By the inverse function theorem, we have $$y = f(k) \implies k = f^{-1}(y) = f^{-1}[f(k)] \implies \frac {\partial f^{-1}(y)}{\partial y} = \frac {1}{f'(k)}$$ Keeping all these relations in mind, we also have $$\dot y = f'(k)\cdot \big[sf(k) - (n+g+\delta)\cdot f^{-1}(y)\big]$$ $$\implies \frac{\partial \dot y}{\partial y} \bigg|_{y=y^*} = \frac {\partial f'(k^*)}{\partial y}\cdot \big[sf(k^*) - (n+g+\delta)\cdot k^*\big]\\ + f'(k^*)\cdot \left[s - (n+g+\delta)\cdot \frac {1}{f'(k^*)} \right]$$ $$\implies \frac{\partial \dot y}{\partial y} \bigg|_{y=y^*} = 0 + sf'(k^*) - (n+g+\delta)$$ etc

Ice Cream Peter’s Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Ice Cream Frozen Desserts Desserts For some reason I find this question very subjective.
In turn, as ice cream prices rise, producers make more of it, and thus more skim milk.
Your ice cream shop has some costs that vary depending on how many half-gallon ice cream packages are made, and some benefits, the revenue from selling ice cream.
all ice creams are frozen desserts but not all frozen desserts are ice creams. if you wanted chocolate ice cream but none was available you are more likely to get vanilla ice cream than pork chops.

Hint 1: So I think you are making a mistake by substituting their production technology into their utility: when you went from $\max 6(1-l_A)+c_A$ to $\max 6(1-l_A)+4l_A$, by doing this, you are assuming that $A$ only consumes what she produces.

First, for clarification, the definition of "change in inventories", taken from page 108 of SNA, version 2008: The basic principle underlying the measurement of changes in inventories of finished goods is that output should be recorded at the time it is produced and valued at the same price whether it is sold, otherwise used or entered into inventories for sale or use later.
But in reality, in order to obtain an actual value for this price index (and hence also of inflation), we must specify a base period, against which we will evaluate the price index for the other periods (past and future).
But when the topic is growth ("how much bigger is it now") the wrong calculation gives incorrect information ("The public debt remained fairly constant from the late 1940s through 1981") and may lead to serious or fatal errors in policy.
GFCF is not a measure of total investment, because only the value of net additions to fixed assets is measured, and all kinds of financial assets are excluded, as well as stocks of inventories and other operating costs (the latter included in intermediate consumption).

My humble opinion is that barring companies owning the shares of other public companies directly or indirectly, there is an upper limit at a fixed discount rate, once the x public companies account for all gdp, it is simply divide that gdp by the discount rate.

As far as i understand in the Krugman target zone model the following equation describes the behaviour of the exchange rate within and outside a target zone $s_t = f_t + \alpha E_t(ds_t/dt)$.
The monthly payment formula is based on the annuity formula. Since the quoted yearly percentage rate is not a compounded rate, the monthly percentage rate is simply the yearly percentage rate divided by 12; dividing the monthly percentage rate by 100 gives r, the monthly rate expressed as a decimal.
washington. I have been reading from this textbook which talks about CPI and inflation http://faculty.

I make those equal at a monthly discount rate of about $0. 122$, though it does depend on how you translate $10\%$ into a monthly interest payment Similarly for Dealer B, I would have thought the payments were $\$4000$ immediately followed by $36$ equal monthly payments of around $\$522.
So I found this example in the net Compound interest formula (including principal): A = P(1+r/n)(nt) If an amount of $5,000 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded monthly, the value of the investment after 10 years can be calculated as follows...

In this paper, the first order conditions for capital and labor of the CES production function under cost minimization imply: $$ log(rk/wl) = -(1-\sigma)log(w/r) + (1-\sigma)log B + \sigma log (\alpha / (1-\alpha))$$ This doesn't seem to require any special non-linear estimation technique.

For each type $l$, we know the number of movements, $n_{l}$, and the overall runway costs, $c_{l}$, associated with type $l$ aircrafts.
You take a pregnancy test if the pregnancy test gives a positive result when you are not pregnant then this is a false positive, a Type I error when the null hypothesis $H_0$ is in fact true but has been rejected by the test if the pregnancy test gives a negative result when you are pregnant then this is a false negative, a Type II error when the null hypothesis $H_0$ is in fact untrue but has not been rejected by the test So in a statement of being a true/false positive/negative test, the true/false part is about the accuracy of the test while the positive/negative part is about the result of the test rather than being the real situation

Would Jill end up with 7 fish and 9 coconuts? Would Bob end up with say 13 fish and 11 coconuts.

Suppose we have the following production function: $$F(L,K)=\max_{L_K}H(L,L_K,K)=\max_{L_K}\left[(L-L_K+1)^\alpha(L_K+K)^{1-\alpha}\right]=(L-L_K^*+1)^\alpha(L_K^*+K)^{1-\alpha}$$ With the constraint $L_K\in[0,L]$.
So, $C(C(A) \cup C(B)) \subseteq C(A \cup B)$. Since $C(A) \cup C(B) = C_{\succeq}(A) \cup C_{\succeq}(B) \subseteq A \cup B$, then $x \succeq y$ for all $y \in C(A) \cup C(B)$, hence $x \in C(C(A) \cup C(B))$, which shows that $C(A \cup B) \subseteq C(C(A) \cup C(B))$.
Choose the problematic set and choose a set B appropriately to get a contradiction of the existence of a maximum (remember that not closed sets might not admit a maximum), this will give you the desired contradiction.
Then $L_K^*=0$. Then $L_K^*=L$. (1) $L_K^0\in [0,L]$. iii) (just to be exhaustive) $L_K^0\notin [0,L]$ and $H(L,0,K)= H(L,L,K)$.
Either $I(x)=I(y)$ or $I(x) \cap I(y)=\phi $ $\forall$ $x,y\in X$ Proof by contradiction Let there be $x,y \in X$ such that $x\neq y$ and $I(x)\neq I(y)$.

For a "stable" base, you can use any average of previous years that "makes sense", that is an average with minimal variance and give an explicit explanation If the last year doesn't deviate from that average then it is unnecessary To demonstrate the momentum effect you can use a moving average, in that case there is no meaning for the base and edge cases are normalized

This is my attempt to link the two papers: Suppose a mediator ("sender" in the Bayesian persuasion language) could pick the information structure ("experiment" in the Bayesian persuasion language) that the DM ("receiver" in the Bayesian persuasion language) could process.
A strategy $P_{Y|T}$ is optimal if it allows the decision maker to maximise her expected payoff: $\forall t\in \mathcal{T}$, $\forall y\in \mathcal{Y}$ such that $P_{Y|t}(y)0$, and $\forall \tilde{y}\in \mathcal{Y}\setminus \{y\}$ $$ \int_{ \mathcal{V}} u(y,v) P_{T|v}(t) P_{V}(\text{d}v) \geq \int_{ \mathcal{V}} u(\tilde{y}, v) P_{T|v}(t) P_{V}(\text{d} v;\theta_v).
Remember that the set of BCE's is the set of decisions that are optimal for some belief about $\mathcal{V}$ that could be formed (as a posterior belief) after observing some signal and having a prior $P_V$.
An optimal strategy of the decision problem above is $P_Y\in \Delta(\mathcal{Y})$ such that, $\forall y\in \mathcal{Y}$ such that $P_Y(y)0$ and $\forall \tilde{y}\neq y$, we have that $$ \sum_{v\in \mathcal{V}} u_i(y,v)P_V(v)\geq \sum_{v\in \mathcal{V}} u_i(\tilde{y},v)P_V(v) $$ Additionally, one can imagine that the DM can process some information structure $S$ to update her prior before choosing an action.

From here, we get that \begin{equation} \begin{split} u_i(v_i)  \geq v_iq(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'})\\ =v_iq(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'}) + v_i^{'}q(v_i^{'}) - v_i^{'}q(v_i^{'}) \\ = (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'}) + (v_i^{'}q(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'}))\\ = (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'}) + u_i(v_i^{'}), \,\,\, or, \\ u_i(v_i)-u_i(v_i^{'})  \geq (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'})\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, -(1) \end{split} \end{equation} Similarly, we can get $$u_i(v_i^{'})-u_i(v_i) \geq (v_i^{'} - v_i)q(v_i)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, -(2)$$ From $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get that $$(v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i^{'}) \leq u_i(v_i)-u_i(v_i^{'}) \leq (v_i - v_i^{'})q(v_i)$$ Given the above expression, is it possible to write the expected utility function as $$u_i(v_i) = u_i(a) + \int_a^{v_i}q_i(t)\, dt,$$ for any distribution.
That is the reason why you can write $$u_i(v_i) \geq u_i(v_i^{'}) = v_iq(v_i^{'})-m_i(v_i^{'})$$ instead of $\widetilde u_i (v_i^{'},v_i) = v_iq(v_i^{'},v_i)-m_i(v_i^{'},v_i)$.
d with pdf $f$ and CDF $F$ over $[0, \hat{v}]$, the revenue that the seller gets for different realizations of players' valuations are as indicated in the graph below: Therefore, expected revenue of the seller is : \begin{eqnarray*} \int_r^\hat{v}\int_r^{v_2} v_1 f(v_1)f(v_2)dv_1dv_2 + \int_r^\hat{v}\int_{v_2}^\hat{v} v_2 f(v_1)f(v_2)dv_1dv_2 \\ +\int_0^r\int_r^\hat{v} r f(v_1)f(v_2)dv_1dv_2 + \int_r^\hat{v}\int_0^r r f(v_1)f(v_2)dv_1dv_2 \\ = \int_r^\hat{v}v_1 (1-F(v_1))f(v_1)dv_1 + \int_r^\hat{v} v_2 (1-F(v_2))f(v_2)dv_2 + 2rF(r)(1-F(r)) \\ = 2\int_r^\hat{v} v_2 (1-F(v_2))f(v_2)dv_2 + 2rF(r)(1-F(r))\end{eqnarray*}
It should be: $$\begin{split} \pi_1(v_1,v_2)=\Pr(v_2\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ =F_{2}(v_2\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ = \beta(v_1)(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ \end{split}$$ $$\begin{split} \left.
I have attempted the following: $$\pi_1(v_1,v_2)=p(v_2\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))$$ $$=(1-\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))$$ If this is an equilibrium, we must have that $$=(1-\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1)) \geq (1-\beta(w))(v_1-\beta(w))$$ for all $w\in[0,1]$.
If the only constraint for them is to be higher than the reserve price $r$, then Amit above has given a very well answer except that $v_1$ or $v_2$ can't get any value less than $r$ in equilibrium, so in his calculations the integrals $\int_0^r\int_r^\hat{v} r f(v_1)f(v_2)dv_1dv_2$ and $ \int_r^\hat{v}\int_0^r r f(v_1)f(v_2)dv_1dv_2 $ are useless.
Discretizing the relationship we could define $$r(v(q_j, q_{j+1})):= \frac{R(q_{j+1})-R(q_j)}{q_{j+1}-q_j} \tag{5}$$ which in terms of $v$ becomes $$r(v(q_j, q_{j+1})):= \frac{v_{j+1}\cdot [1- F(v\leq v_{j+1})] -v_{j}\cdot [1- F(v\leq v_{j})]}{1- F(v\leq v_{j+1})-1+F(v\leq v_{j})} $$ $$=\frac{v_{j+1}\cdot Pr(v  v_{j+1}) -v_{j}\cdot Pr(v  v_{j})}{-Pr(v=v_{j+1})}$$ Using $$Pr(v  v_{j}) = Pr(v=v_{j+1}) + Pr(vv_{j+1})$$ we get $$r(v_j,v_{j+1}) = v_{j} - (v_{j+1}-v_j)\cdot \frac{Pr(vv_{j+1})}{Pr(v=v_{j+1})}$$ or $$r(v_j,v_{j+1}) = v_{j} - (v_{j+1}-v_j)\cdot \frac{1-F(v_{j+1})}{Pr(v=v_{j+1})} \tag{6}$$ Since to a first approximation, if $v$ is continuous, and $v_j,v_{j+1}$ are "close enough" we have $$Pr[v \in (v_j,v_{j+1})] \approx f(v_{j+1}) \cdot (v_{j+1}-v_{j})$$ It is clear how the obtained relation for the discrete case can be seen as the analogue of the continuous case.
In, particular, if values are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, we have $F(v_i)=v_i$ and the equation becomes $$(n-1)v_i^{n-2}[v_i-b(v_i)]-v_i^{n-1}b'(v_i)=0,$$ which can be simplified to $$(n-1)\frac{1}{v_i}[v_i-b(v_i)]=b'(v_i).
In terms of the original equation this gives $$ \int_{a_2}^{b_2} \int_{a_1}^{\min\{v_2,b_1\}} \left[ v_2 f_2\left( v_2 \right) + F_2\left( v_2 \right) - 1 \right] f_1\left( v_1 \right) dv_1 dv_2 \\\hspace{3cm}= \int_{a_2}^{b_2} \left[ v_2 f_2\left( v_2 \right) + F_2\left( v_2 \right) - 1 \right] F_1\left( v_2 \right) dv_2.
Now using your notation, we are told that we should calculate $$V_{n+1}(a) = V_n(a) + \Delta$$ where $$\Delta = \ u(c(a^*)) + \dfrac{\partial V_n(a)}{\partial a}da_t(a^*) - \rho V_n(a)$$ Insert the second into the first to see what the iteration rule is: $$V_{n+1}(a) = V_n(a) + \ u(c(a^*)) + \dfrac{\partial V_n(a)}{\partial a}da_t(a^*) - \rho V_n(a)$$ When you reach a point where $$V_{n+1}(a) = V_n(a) $$ (or $\epsilon$-so) It will mean $$\rho V_n(a)= \ u(c(a^*)) + \dfrac{\partial V_n(a)}{\partial a}da_t(a^*) $$ which is what you have to satisfy.

capitalism, industrial, agrarian, keynesianism, mercantilism, revolution, exploitation, century, th, difference
What's the difference between "industrial capitalism" and "agrarian capitalism" and "mercantilism" and the "industrial revolution" and the 20th century ideas of "Keynesianism"?
You are talking about the inverse of the exploitation rate. Surplus value = exploitation rate x use value Wages = (1/exploitation rate) x use value
New Old Keynesianism delineates the differences between Old Old Keynesianism, Old New Keynesianism, New Old Keynesianism and New New Keynesianism such that "New" means “post Global Financial Crisis” and “Old” to refers to a belief that the economy can be in a long-run high unemployment equilibrium.
) How did the creeping inflation linked to the price revolution cause the industrial revolution?
It was the Industrial revolution that divided "work"(e.g. Until the industrial revolution came each household operated like a mini business.
He does sometimes say things that contradict academic Keynesianism. The fact that corporations hoard less cash during recessions doesn't necessarily contradict Keynesianism or New Keynesianism, but it does require these theories to explain why corporations behave this way (which the theorists have not attempted).
Each food worker produces 6 units of food and each clothing worker produces 3 units of clothing.
Put simply, Mercantilism can be enunciated as: Mercantilism focuses on wealth accumulation through extraction of wealth which they believe is measured by the amount of gold bullions that the nation has in its possession.
I can't confirm this is true but it's said by the president of one of the main agrarian organizations of Argentina, probably with statistics made by them and/or data of the national institute of agrarian technology.

Here are the correct expressions: $$\frac{\partial W}{\partial p_i} = -\gamma_i \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\beta_j}{I - \sum_{k=1}^n p_k \gamma_k} - \frac{\beta_i}{p_i} = -\frac{\gamma_i}{I - \sum_{j=1}^n p_j \gamma_j} - \frac{\beta_i}{p_i} $$ $$ \frac{\partial W}{\partial I} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\beta_j}{I - \sum_{k=1}^n p_k \gamma_k} = \frac{1}{I - \sum_{j=1}^n p_j \gamma_j} $$ Roy's identity then gives you the Marshallian demand you've initially, and correctly, derived.

The Stone-Gerry production function generally takes a form of: $$f(x_{i})=\prod_{i=1}^n(x_{i}-a_{i})^{\gamma_i}$$ where $x_i$ represents all inputs in the model, $a_i$ is a constant representing the initial investment which does not contribute to production and $\gamma_{i}$represent output elasticies.
The closest I can think of is Stone-Geary utility/preferences, where consumption is assumed to provide utility only above a specific level (the $\gamma_i$ parameter in the link), which is usually designated as the "subsistence level".
In the linear regression model $E(y|X)=x'\beta$, and so we're capable of interpreting a $\beta_i$ as $\Delta E(y|\text{all fixed except } x_i)=\beta_i \Delta x_i$.
Would someone show me how you go about converting 2001 euros to 1990 Geary–Khamis dollars?

q_b, c_b, c_g, q_g, pi, y_b, y_g, x_b, c_, cointegrated
$ x_g$ and $ x_b $ is the quantity of state contingent claims, while $ q_g$ and $ q_b$ is the price of these state contingent claims.
However, crucial caveat here is that this holds only asymptotically and only for $R^2$ close to unity.
So there is a number $u_1$ such that $$ \forall (q_B,q_A) \in IC_1: \ U(q_B,q_A) = u_1.
Now calculate consumption at golden rule level $$c_G=f(k_G)-(δ+n)k_G$$ $$c_G=(k_G)^a-(δ+n)k_G$$ $$c_G=(\frac{a}{(δ+n)})^{a/1-a}-(δ+n)(\frac{a}{(δ+n)})^{1/1-a}$$ $$c_G=(\frac{a}{(δ+n)})^{a/1-a}[1-(δ+n)(\frac{a}{(δ+n)})]$$ $$c_G=(\frac{a}{(δ+n)})^{a/1-a}[1-a]$$ $$c_G=k_G^a[1-a]$$ Ow consider to calculate wage $w=f(k)-kf’(k)=(1-a)f(k)$ Then, $$c_G=k_G^a[1-a]=w_G$$ $$c_G=w_G$$ Now consider aggregate version, $C_G/L=W_G/L$ so, $C_G=W_G$ I am confused at the aggregate transformation.
Don't be fooled: Granger Causality does not imply causality. Granger Causality is exactly what you are looking for.
Repeat for $Q_b$. 2Q_b^2-100(Q_a+Q_b)-1000000 $$ First order conditions $$ \frac{d\pi}{dQ_a}=1000-2Q_a - 100 $$ $$ \frac{d\pi}{dQ_b}=2000-0.
John Cochrane offers an astute example of Granger causality by stating that a weatherman Granger-causes the weather.
$C_B  1$. $C_B \geq 1$. Since B doesn't care about A, you should be able to find B's consumption $(C_B, l_B)$ using standard method (maximizing utility w.r.t.
$$ Divide both sides by $Y_s^{\frac{\rho-1}{\rho}}$ to obtain $$\left(\frac{Y}{Y_g}\right)^{\frac{\rho-1}{\rho}} = 1 + \left(\frac{Y_s}{Y_g}\right)^{\frac{\rho-1}{\rho}}.
In the problem below, u is a utility function; $\beta$ is a discount factor; pc(s) is the price for a contingent claim for state s.

money, rate, bank, interest, inflation, would, bond, government, debt, central
Too low, and the opposite happens: sell bonds; less money; less excess reserves; more borrowers; higher interest rates; lower inflation.
Or more aptly, they may believe the only way you can pay this interest is by printing money, decreasing the value of money and potentially leading to inflation or a runaway zimbabwe situation So the destruction of currency reduces the financial liabilities of a central bank, benefitting its balance sheet.
Individuals who wanted to foolishly lend to banks without the backing of the Fed could do so if they REALLY wanted to, but few would as the banking system would burn up in a liquidity fire without Fed support to prop up maturity mismatching by constantly providing artificial levels of short term debt to the banking system.
Now Bank A has an asset: a loan to B Bank A has a liability: Bank A owes money to Bank D Bank D has an asset: Bank A owes money to Bank D Bank D has a liability: C's deposit with Bank D Bank A now needs to settle with Bank D: this can happen through clearing if other customers are moving money to Bank A, but it is easier to imagine that Bank A tells the central bank to give some of A's reserve deposits there to Bank D.
Since banks borrow money from the central bank, they must lend at higher rates than they are borrowing in order to turn a profit, so setting the interest rate is a potent means of encouraging or halting inflation.
Most money only ever exists as accounting transactions, and most money is generally created by regular banks rather than the central bank.
For example, the Federal Reserve "buys" X billion dollars worth of US 30-year T-Bills from JPMorgan by simply taking possession of the T-Bills and credits JPMorgan's deposit account X billion dollars.
Since October 2008, the Fed offers banks 25 basis points per annum for their deposits (including excess deposits over the required reserves), but pays zero interest on deposits from nonbanks, especially GSEs.
I am going to be reluctant to give someone my money for five years if, by the time I get it back, it is worthless—I'd rather spend the money now while it's still worth something.
However, since the private bank is borrowing from the central bank, money is flowing from the private sector back to the central bank, reducing the money supply.

Further, if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}[Y|X = x] = \mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}[Y]$.
If $S_Y$ is the amount saved by $Y$ in the first period, and $T_X$ is the amount transferred by $X$ to $Y$ in the second period, then $X$'s payoff as function of his choice $T_X$, taking as given $Y$'s choice $S_Y$ is $$\ln(I - T_X) + a\left(\ln(I-S_Y) + b\ln(S_Y+T_X)\right)$$ $X$ will choose $T_X$ by solving the following problem : $$\max_{T_X \geq 0} \ \ \ln(I - T_X) + a\left(\ln(I-S_Y) + b\ln(S_Y+T_X)\right)$$ First-order condition for optimality is: $$\frac{1}{I-T_X} =\frac{ab}{S_Y + T_X} $$ Solving it for $T_X$ we get, $$T_X = \frac{abI-S_Y}{ab+1}$$ This is the best response transfer function of $X$.

The other way to have multiple states defect in the same period is the interesting case.
As most supplies have in some sense a service and a product component, general zero-rating of services would create huge incentives to artificially split out product and service compoments to save on VAT, leading to huge tax bureaucracy and litigation.

Sometimes, companies that are essentially still under the control of the founders &mdash; even though they have done an initial public offering and are now publicly traded &mdash; will do a secondary offering in which the company itself purchases stock from the founders, and sells that stock on the market, rather than actually issuing new stock.

"substitution patterns between exchange transplants and other transplant outcomes" would, I think, be better phrased as "patterns of substitution of exchange for other transplant outcomes".
Suppose (for contradiction) that SR cost curve is above the LR cost curve at point $x$ on LR cost curve.
I didn't work out the proof myself but found in Wikipedia another version of the CES production function that has the same shape as your cost production function by replacing $1-\sigma$ with $r$.
To give some context the author says the following: "I analyze the substitution patterns between exchange transplants and other transplant outcomes" What does this mean in layman terms?
First, in IS LM model where in classical case, when LM curve is vertical increase in government expenditures have no increase in output i.e.
This might be in the form of job change (silica miner move to coal miner), or might be in the form of task redefinition (the book Prediction Machines describe how self-driving school bus might shift the main task of a school bus driver to an adult who oversees and "teaches" the schoolchildren.
Then my costs will be function of both labor $L$ and quantity $Q$. If I have wage $w = 200$ and rental rate $r = 3050$ on short run, I can assume that $K=1$ and then get the total costs $TC = rK+wL = 3050 + 200L$.
I am trying to give a puzzle from behavioral economics illustrating on the irrationality of thinking of costs in proportional rather than absolute terms.
Hence, if $TC(q)$ is the total cost for the given level of quantity $q$, then $FC=TC(0)$ is the fixed cost, which is a constant independent of $q$; and $VC(q)=TC(q)-FC$ is the variable cost.
In the answer to this question, the answerer said "the minimum point of a short run cost curve will be above the long run cost curve".

Applying the chain rule we get: $\frac{\partial \Pi_t}{\partial Y_t(j)}=P_t \left(\int_0^1 Y_t(j)^{1-\nu} \ dj \right)^{\frac{\nu}{1-\nu}} Y_t(j)^{-\nu}-P_t(j)=0$ At this point, the trick of the trade is that $\left(\int_0^1 Y_t(j)^{1-\nu} \ dj \right)^{\frac{\nu}{1-\nu}}$ which is a part of the FOC, equals $Y_t^{\nu}$ (check the first equation) Setting $\left(\int_0^1 Y_t(j)^{1-\nu} \ dj \right)^{\frac{\nu}{1-\nu}}= Y_t^{\nu}$ in the FOC, and solving for $Y_t(j)$ will give the desired result.
As the Frisch elasticity here is given by $\nu$, I would calibrate $\nu$ to be between 0.
In this context, $\nabla_\nu \varphi_\nu(x)$ is a vector of size $n_\nu$. In this case, define the $\nu$-th player's strategy vector $x^\nu \in R^{n_\nu}$ and so $x=(x^1,\dots,x^N)^T$ of a size $n_1+\dots+n_N$ for a $N$ player game.
The startup has a pre-money valuation of 1M. Let's say that the startup, after 1 year, raise a Series A round.
] yields": $$w_t - p_t = \sigma c_t + \varphi n_t + \chi (\nu - \sigma) (c_t - (m_t - p_t))$$ with $\chi = \frac{ \vartheta^{\frac1\nu} (1 - \beta)^{1 - \frac1\nu} }{ (1 - \vartheta)^{\frac1\nu} + \vartheta^{\frac1\nu}(1 - \beta)^{1 - \frac1\nu} }$.
$n$ might be properly measured in units of 15. Consider the leisure part of the utility function: $$ - \alpha \frac{n^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}$$ We can rewrite it like this: $$ - (\alpha^{\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}})^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}} \frac{n^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}} = - \frac{(n\cdot (\alpha^{\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}))^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}} $$ Define $\gamma = (\alpha^{\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}})$ and rewrite the utility function in terms of $\gamma$ instead of $\alpha$ $$ u(c, n) = \log (c) - \frac{(\gamma \cdot n)^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}$$ Written this way, I see $\gamma$ and therefore $\alpha$ as serving as a unit shifter.
Is it possile that central banks are secretly stealing from the economy by printing money when the the dollar deflates, so the dollar stay the same value and nobody notice it?
However, his solution - in (4) - puts $\epsilon (t)$ in the first equation of (2) instead of $\nu (t-1)$, and $\nu (t-1)$ instead of $\epsilon (t)$.

advertising, fa, ca, bop, oa, ka, cola, u_i, increasing, pepsi
The second equation follows from the first: $CA + KA = FA \wedge OA \neq 0 \Rightarrow FA - OA = CA +KA -OA \neq CA +KA$.
Ideally I would have posed this as a clarificatory comment, but I lack the reputation level to post one.
Some sources classify it as CA = KA (and do not have an FA), but the principle is the same.
EDIT: The question was the following given: $rb=-1491, ka=2280, rf=-1551, rb+ka+eo=-3282$ calculate $bop$ and $eo$ answer is: $eo=-4071$ and $bop=-1731$ and one more thing: $rb+ka+eo-rf=bop$ and $rb+ka+eo-ka-rb=eo$ that is all i know.
BUT at the same time, brands like Pepsi or Coca-Cola have relatively stronger consumer loyalty than other brands.

Whenever you enter one entry in the BOP (say in the CA), there must be an equal and opposite entry somewhere else (often this will be in the FA, but it can be anywhere, including even in the CA again).
And so for Singapore, the BOP identity can be written as: CA + KFA + ΔR = 0. And very confusingly, Singapore then defines BOP = CA + KFA = -ΔR.
For example, if the price of Coca Cola increases from 50p to 60p per can, and the demand for Pepsi Cola increases from 1m to 2m per year, the CED between the two products is: +100/+20 = (+) 5 i.e.

And the results of this paper are not amazing for DSGE: Two forecasting exercises have been implemented on US quarterly economy data: the first one considering a simple forecasting one-step-ahead strategy with different samples, and the second a h-steps ahead evaluation with a rolling forecasting estimation.
To see this, consider the outcomes of the Allais paradox: $$M^T=\begin{bmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\ 1  1  0  0 \\ 1  5  0  0 \\ 1  0  1  0 \\ 1  1  1  0 \\ 1  5  1  0 \\ 1  0  0  5 \\ 1  1  0  5 \\ 1  5  0  5 \\ 1  0  1  5 \\ 1  1  1  5 \\ 1  5  1  5 \end{bmatrix}$$ Where each column represents one of the four gambles.
Or are they just good at "analyzing" the sample(through Granger tests, IRF's etc) and bad out-of-sample forecasters?
I tested 4 different method but without achieving an ARMA-GARCH simulation with my data.
I am awared of the following: Tobit (Tobin, 1958), Two-Stage Model (Heckman, 1979), Two-Parts Model (Duan et al.
That paper has a highly accurate approximation for Tobin's Q using Compustat. If you are interested in Tobin's (average) q, you might find useful A Simple Approximation of Tobin's q (Chung and Pruitt (1994)).
You then compare your forecast predictions to known data and to those of other forecasts.
What about the forecast error. What will be the impact of estimating AR(P-1) on the estimated coefficients of $\phi_1 - \phi_{p-1}$, can they be consistently estimated.
However in population forecasting, can ARIMA models be interpreted in a meaningful way?
They generate different performances (e.g. DSGE models and BVARs are commonly used in academia and policy circles.
