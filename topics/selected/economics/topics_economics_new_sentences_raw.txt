I use a Dickey-Fuller test to test for stationarity and concluded that both of my series are non-stationary.
I might be wrong but from what you write, it seems you've been given a "classical" introduction to econometrics: You've covered IVs and Diff-in-diff but apparently only in passing, and causal inference does not look like it was the core of the classes you've taken.
An urn contains equal number of green and red balls. The ball is then placed back in the urn, and the selection process is repeated.
The expected number of superballs is the expected number of urns with a nonzero number of red balls.
$good_2(good_1)$), which simplistically means solving $good_1= -a\times good_2 +b$ for $good_2 $; $$ good_2(good_1)=-\frac{1}{a}\times good_1 +\frac{b}{a}$$ i.e.
Do I need to convert the governance indicators (-2. All indicators range from -2.
Say I have $U$ urns, and some balls. Some urns will have more than one ball, some might have none.
What you shall do is to test for stationarity of residuals obtianed from cointegration vector.
It seems that the Coase Theorem presume that if a deal can be made, it will be made.

Although I am not a macroeconomist, I am confident to say that search models recognized as a key ingredient to explain unemployment in equilibrium.
The other question is whether there is any effect colloquially similar to the 'magical chairs' game in which the latest resident to move into a region of increased popularity will not reap the rewards obtained by the prior residents?
Similarly, Army 2 attacks ($A$) in both types in this case. Say, we have $\textbf{(A,NA)}$ as army 1's strategy and $\textbf{(A,A)}$ as army 2's strategy, it means, Army 1 attacks ($A$) when it is of type "Strong" and does not attack ($NA$) when it is of type "Weak".

Assuming China has a 30% inflation rate, while USA and Lebanon have 0 inflation rate, then the fact that the inflation rate differential between China and USA is 30%, while the Chinese nominal exchange rate was devalued by only 20%, implies that in real terms, the Chinese currency (relative to both the USD and Lebanese Pound) has actually appreciated by approximately 10%=30%-20%, leading to Chinese exports looking more expensive to Americans and Lebanese, and American and Lebanese imports looking cheaper to the Chinese.
Furthermore, before having a deficit, the US has had a surplus for a very long time, so it is natural it would eventually have a deficit.
The Australian economy is almost tied to the hip to China – about one-third of its exports go to Greater China and, perhaps more importantly, two-thirds of its exports are products where China sets the price: coal, iron ore, wool, metals, etc.
For this given nominal exchange rate, my purchasing power would decline if I exchanged all my pounds to dollars, as U.S.A.
I know that if a country exports more than it imports (a "favorable" balance of trade), there is a greater demand for its goods - and thus, a greater demand for its currency - on the Foreign Exchange Market.
This will have two effects: (a) this will shift the IS curve further to the right (because net exports have risen, and so Y has risen) and (b) this will shift the BP curve to the right (because net exports have risen, improving the current account balance).
I'm reviewing a previous AP Macroeconomics exam and I saw the following question: The United States and South Korea are trading partners, and the United States has a zero current account balance.
For this question, I feel like it would not be possible to derive a preference relation of the entire electorate because it seems that no one candidate is strongly/weakly preferred.
In countries with high infant and child mortality rates, however, the average number of births may need to be much higher.
if the home country's inflation rate is lower than that of the foreign country, then all else equal, the home currency should depreciate in real terms as the domestic consumption basket becomes cheaper relative to the foreign consumption basket some of the confusion abounds because of the different quoting conventions (X vs 1/X, foreign vs domestic, etc)

price, market, agent, model, bid, asset, stock, auction, expectation, seller
This is the very general statement that can be found from here and there: Investopedia: This principle is called the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which asserts that the market is able to correctly price securities in a timely manner based on the latest information available.
In general, the difference between the fundamental value of an asset and its market price constitutes, to some degree, bubble behavior.
For example: Buyers: Buyer 1: bid price = 30 cent Buyer 2: bid price = 25 cent Buyer 3: bid price = 20 cent Buyer 4: bid price = 15 cent And the ask prices of the sellers per item: Sellers: Seller 1: ask price = 25 cent Seller 2: ask price = 20 cent From what I understand is, that there would be just one clearing price and Buyers 1 and 2 will both purchase an item from Seller 1 and 2 for 20 cent, instead of 30 and 25 cent.
In your example, the market clearing price is $25$ as there are two buying bids at that price or higher and two selling bids at that price or lower, and no other price achieves this match So Buyer $1$ and Buyer $2$ both pay $25$ and Seller $1$ and Seller $2$ both receive $25$ If you want actual examples, you could look at the shares of Tottenham Hotspur Limited (the football club) on Asset Match and the Auction results (almost every month) in the right hand column.
Hence, the weights of all assets in the market portfolio must be non-negative as well.
The key to problems like this is that it cannot be simplified to one representative buyer and one representative seller.
In addition to this, complete or incomplete markets have always the so-called Arrow-Debreu sense of complete/incomplete markets?
The new classicals sidestepped the problem of aggregation either by imagining an economy composed of identical individuals or by assuming that there is one individual who represents the whole economy, so that the solution to the optimization problem of this representative agent gives the aggregate relationships in that economy.
Iterative Auction: The auctioneer repeats the auction and the traders submit bids/asks until a purpose (welfare maximization etc.
In current mainstream macro practice, the representative-agent (RA) assumption (of DSGE models and nearly identified with them) side-steps the SMD: The theorems of Hugo Sonnenschein, Rolf Mantel and Gerard Debreu in the early 1970s established that the restrictions that generate well-behaved individual demand functions do not constrain aggregate demand functions to exhibit the same properties [...].

There are papers that propose social choice rules whose output is an incomplete social preference relation (or even an intransitive social preference relation), and their authors might still describe these rules as satisfying "unrestricted domain" because all they ever wanted was an incomplete (or even intransitive) relation.
How can we use the same $\theta$ in the proof while the definition clearly states $u(\theta)\geq \theta q(\theta')-t(\theta'),\forall\theta,\theta'$?

Just integrate out $(t_i,t_{-i})$ in $\Pr(a_i,a_{-i},t_i,t_{-i},\theta)$ to get that joint distribution.
I get something like this: $\int^\bar\theta_\underline\theta u(\theta) dF(\theta) = u(\theta)F(\theta)|^\bar\theta_\underline\theta - \int^\bar\theta_\underline\theta F(\theta)v_\theta(q(\theta),\theta)d\theta$ I can simplify this a bit further, but it does not simplify to the authors' expression.
Similar argument for 2.8. By definition we have $$ \begin{align*} u(\theta)  = \theta q(\theta)-t(\theta) \\ \\ u(\theta + \delta)  = (\theta + \delta) q(\theta + \delta)-t(\theta + \delta) \end{align*} $$ By incentive compatibility (where $\theta + \delta$ is the true type, $\theta$ is the false type) we have $$ u(\theta + \delta) \geq (\theta + \delta) q(\theta)-t(\theta) $$ Using these (I used square brackets for clearer notation, there is no mathematical function to them) $$ \begin{align*} u(\theta + \delta) - u(\theta)  = \left[(\theta + \delta) q(\theta + \delta)-t(\theta + \delta)\right] - \left[\theta q(\theta)-t(\theta)\right] \\ \\ u(\theta + \delta) - u(\theta)  \geq \left[(\theta + \delta) q(\theta)-t(\theta)\right] - \left[\theta q(\theta)-t(\theta)\right] \end{align*} $$ This also holds if you divide by $\delta  0$.

Both supply and demand share the same change in quantity as a result of the tax, so $$\Delta Q_S = \Delta Q_D$$ The amount by which the quantities changed is the derivative of that quantity wrt price, times the change in price that side experienced $$\frac{\partial Q_S}{\partial P_S}\Delta P_S = \frac{\partial Q_D}{\partial P_D}\Delta P_D$$ Multiply both sides by the equilibrium P/Q $$\frac{\partial Q_S}{\partial P_S}(\frac{P^*}{Q^*})\Delta P_S = \frac{\partial Q_D}{\partial P_D}(\frac{P^*}{Q^*})\Delta P_D$$ which of course is the formula for elasticity at the equilibrium $$\varepsilon_S \Delta P_S = \varepsilon_D \Delta P_D$$ $$\frac{\varepsilon_S}{\varepsilon_D}\Delta P_S = \Delta P_D$$ So then the producer's share is $$Incidence_S=\frac{P^*-P_S}{T}=\frac{|\Delta P_S|}{|\Delta P_S|+|\Delta P_D|} = \frac{|\Delta P_S|}{|\Delta P_S|+|\frac{\varepsilon_S}{\varepsilon_D}\Delta P_S|}$$ the price change cancels out and you get producer's share as $$Incidence_S=\frac{1}{1+|\frac{\varepsilon_S}{\varepsilon_D}|}=\frac{|\varepsilon_D|}{|\varepsilon_D|+\varepsilon_S}$$ So it all comes from the fact that this is the unique formula that produces the price-change ratios that generate identical quantity changes in both sides of the market.

Since $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is the Nash Equilibrium of $G$, \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*))   \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2))   \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} The above can also be rewritten as \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) + d_1 \geq \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*)) + d_1   \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) + d_2 \geq \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2)) + d_2   \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} Because $d_1$ and $d_2$ are constants, we can take them inside the expectation and rewrite the above inequalities as: \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) + d_1) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*) + d_1)   \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) + d_2) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2) + d_2)   \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} By definition of $v_1$ and $v_2$, \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(v_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(v_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*))   \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(v_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(v_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2))   \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} Therefore, $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is also the Nash Equilibrium of $G'$.

Let's address your question in a canonical manner. the interest rate or the cost of debt is denoted by $r_D$ (naturally $r_D  r$) the share of debt in the capital structure of the company is denoted by $X\%$ the corporate tax rate is denoted by $T_c$ It follows that the average cost of capital (average over equity and debt), $r'$, is such that $r' = X\% r_D (1-T_c) + (1-X\%) r$ In your case, $X\% = 100\% = 1$, then $r' = r_D(1-T_c)$.

Simple supply and demand economics would suggest that the huge increase in the supply of rooms to rent by Airbnb should have reduced the price of rental significantly in those cities where Airbnb is most popular.
1Associate head of the School for Aviation and Security at Buckinghamshire New University Note 1: This question does not belong on Aviation.
We find Airbnb’s presence in a market has a negative effect on hotel occupancy rates, but a positive effect on total hotel revenue and the average daily rate they charge.
But if that is the case, perhaps the demand for the short-term rental in that city has increased?

, McGraw-Hill 2005, for more on total differentials. For the first step, as in your previous question, simply use the rules of total differentials, specifically the product rule that states that for variables $X$ and $Y$, the total differential of $XY$ is given by $$d(XY) = Y \, dX + X \, dY$$ Assuming that $s_\pi$, $s_W$ and $\zeta$ are (constant) parameters (so that by the constant rule, $ds_\pi = ds_W = d\zeta = 0$), we can apply this to your equation: $$\begin{align} d\mu  = d \left[ s_\pi - v (s_\pi - s_W) + \zeta \right] \\  = ds_\pi - d \left[ v (s_\pi - s_W) \right] + d\zeta \\  = -\left[ (s_\pi - s_W) \, dv + v \, d(s_\pi - s_W) \right] \\  = -(s_\pi - s_W) \, dv \end{align}$$ Now divide both sides by $\mu$, noting that since $\dot v = \frac{ dv }v$, we also have $dv = v \dot v$: $$\begin{align} \dot\mu = \frac{ d\mu }\mu  = -\frac{ dv }\mu (s_\pi - s_W) \\  = -\frac v\mu (s_\pi - s_W) \dot v \end{align}$$ which is the desired result.

Thing is, many theories of utility (and behavioral economics experiments) expect that it can be nonlinear, and that "50% chance of +100 and 50% chance of -100" and "certain 0" are not equivalent, there can be a strong preference for one or the other depending on circumstances.

Having been around members of all these organizations, I found them all to be out of touch although I would say that ideally, Libertarianism makes more sense to me these days, but grabbing on to an ideology is never a good way to develop a full and healthy understanding of economics and our world today.
Mises’s answer is that economics is the science of human action… It is this assessment of economics as an a priori science, a science whose propositions can be given a rigorous logical justification, which distinguishes Austrians, or more precisely Misesians, from all other current economic schools.
Among the references in the paper hinted by indigo_luc, there's one (Mearman, 2011), which [was apparently the first that] has surveyed some (43) self-styled heterodox economists and applied factor analysis as well as cluster analysis to their ideas: [The first factor is addressed in the next para.
So I do not think it is at all correct to define market failure as when "the production or consumption of a good or service causes additional positive or negative externalities on a third party not involved in the economic activity".
The first is governed by uncertainty: the good’s value is what the customer is willing to pay, it difficult for the seller to calculate all the costs involved in selling the good, and without specialization there is no knowledge to calculate how much of items must be sold for price X to reach the certain profitability.
Something like the effect of a rent ceiling, the role of adverse selection in a market, the potential benefits of free trade, or the static welfare effects of monopoly appear to be fairly well understood (at least by social science standards) because economists are in broad agreement, these things are not well-understood in society at large, and economists' views on these issues are generally bourne out empirically.
One of the examples is Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, which is used as a basis for major consensus in the economics profession, and a key driver of the free trade movement, was prepared before the existence of large scale trade data.
the tools to do so were invented by Leontieff in the 60's he and his disciples had all the legitimacy they needed (Turgot, a disciple of Quesnay, eventually become finance Minister) The point I'm trying to make is that lack of mathematical rigor in classical econs does not necessarily mean that they are irrelevant.
Clearly, unskilled worker's work is not worth that much, so at least one of two things must happen now: Skilled worker needs to agree to be paid less or If no skilled worker with x2 efficiency agrees to be paid less then the skilled worker will be replaced with even more skilled worker whose efficiency is higher than x2, so that the employer can maintain the same profit margin.
George Stigler, also reviewing the 1988's Palgrave Dictionary of Economics: Even if one is prepared to concede (as I certainly am not) that this emphasis on Marx and Sraffa is justified by their importance in modern or earlier economics, that would not justify the frequent penetration of Marxian views into the treatment of what are surely non-Marxian subjects.

In the second case, the easiest way to succeed is for consumers with $WTP  P_1$ to tell producers "I'll pay you more than $P_1$ (but still less than my WTP) if you promise you will sell your product to me rather than another consumer", which initiates an upward price-trend.
This would create growth, allowing more doctors and nurses to come through but more importantly create additional bed space.

A leftward shift of the supply curve is also an upward shift of the supply curve: Leftward shift: At every price, producers are willing to produce and sell fewer units of the good.
The parking lots would want to get that first row filled up as icing on the cake, then let them sit there through the day as the cars they parked in the accessible ring arrived and left throughout the day.

The GATS covers four modes of supply: (1) cross-border supply; (2) supply through the movement of consumers to the location of the supplier; (3) supply though the establishment in a country of the commercial presence of legal entities from another country; and (4) the supply through natural persons of one country in the territory of another.
As I understand it countries negotiate free trade agreements in services using the WTO GATS.

The aggregation of this sort of situation over many households can explain the coexistence of poverty and saving on a significant scale.
Which means we devote more and more to services... But as farm productivity increases more, we eat the same, but it costs less and less to produce it, so we devote less and less of or budget to it.

By linearity of the payoff function you have, $\forall s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$: $$ \pi(\sigma_i',s_{-i})=p_{s_i}\pi(s_i',s_{-i}) + (1-p_{s_i})\pi(\Lambda_i,s_{-i})  p_{s_i}\pi(s_i,s_{-i}) + (1-p_{s_i})\pi(\Lambda_i,s_{-i}) = \pi(\sigma_i,s_{-i}) $$ where $\Lambda_i$, loosely speaking, denotes the residual combination of strategies played in $\sigma_i$, apart from $s_i$, inherited by $\sigma_i'$ too.
for $s_i, s_i' \in S_i$ $$u_i(s_i \vee s_i', s_{-i})+u_i(s_i \wedge s_i', s_{-i}) \geq u_i(s_i , s_{-i})+u_i(s_i', s_{-i})$$ Or For $i \in I$, $u_i$ is upper-semicontinuous, i.e.
Player $i$'s payoff function is: $v_i(s_i,s_{j})=$ $-s_i$ if $s_is_{j}$ ($\frac{1}{2}-s_i$) if $s_i=s_{j}$ ($1-s_i$) if $s_is_j$.

So knowing $GDPc = \frac{GDP}{pop}$ you can write: $$ \tau_{GDPc} = \frac{\frac{GDP(t)}{pop(t)} - \frac{GDP(t-1)}{pop(t-1)}}{ \frac{GDP(t-1)}{pop(t-1)}}$$ With the definition of the rate of change, you write $$pop(t)= pop(t-1)*(\tau_{pop}+1) $$ You can then simplify the $pop(t-1)$ term in the previous equation and you get $$\tau_{GDPc} = \frac{1}{\tau_{pop}+1}\left[\frac{GDP(t)-GDP(t-1)}{GDP(t-1)}-\tau_{pop}\right] $$ $$\tau_{GDPc} = \frac{1}{\tau_{pop}+1}\left[\tau_{GDP}-\tau_{pop}\right]$$ It is indeed different than Brandon marcus answer.
Also note how the input of unskilled labor in the manufacturing sector has been replaced by $H_u^m=H_u-H_u^f$, that is to say, the manufacturing sector uses all the unskilled labor that is left over from the farming sector (we assume that the stock of unskilled labor ($H_u$) is fixed for the period of study).

By the maximum principle optimality requires that the Hamiltonian \begin{align} H_1(k,\tau_1,\tau_2^*,\lambda_1) := F(k,\tau_1,\tau_2^*) + \lambda_1 f(k,\tau_1,\tau_2^*) \end{align} is concave in $(k,\tau_1,\tau_2)$ (sufficient condition).
So the total tax rate on capital is $$\tau_c = \tau_d+\tau_{\pi}-\tau_d\tau_{\pi}$$ In your case $\tau_d\tau_{\pi} = 0.

I was thinking about how online gambling could cause numerous governments to face a reduction in tax revenue from conventional gambling, upon which taxes do apply in most countries.

p_x, p_y, l_, r, frac, omega, refugee, c, p_z, change
Suppose we have two goods, price changes in the two are independent; having seen this question I am considering why the change in total Consumer Surplus is the sum of the change in Consumer Surplus for the two goods separately (if this is true)?
I get that the Hicksian and Marshallian demand functions are $x^* = \frac{p_y}{p_x} y = \frac{I}{2 p_x} $ respectively.
Now suppose I increase $p_x$ to $p_x'$. Suppose I have the utility function $$U(x,y) = \sqrt{x} + y$$ subject to budget constraint $$p_x x + p_y y = m$$ Then $$x_M =\frac{p_y^2}{4 p_x^2}$$ $$y_M = \frac{m}{p_y} - \frac{p_y}{4 p_x}$$ where $M$ denotes Marshallian.
He exhausts his wealth (his endowment): $4 p_x + 1 p_y = w = x_d p_x + y_d p_y$ We can use this to solve for $y_d = (4 p_x + 1 p_y) / (p_y + 2 p_x)$ (eqn 1) and $x_d = 2 (4 p_x + 1 p_y) / (p_y + 2 p_x)$ (eqn 2).
Imagine I have a continuum of different goods indexed by $\omega \in [0,1]$. That is, defining $$U(C) = \int_{0}^1 C(\omega) \delta_{\omega} d\omega$$ where $\delta(\omega)$ is a ``function'' which is equal to $+\infty$ at $\omega$ and $0$ everywhere else.
1p_y}-\frac{p_x}{p_y}x \end{equation} where the relative price is still $\frac{p_x}{p_y}$.
Suppose, price of $x$ is $p_x$; price of $y$ is $p_y$ . So, the income of the consumer = $10 p_y$ And the corresponding budget constraint will be: $x p_x + y p_y = 10p_y$ Vertical intercept $(0, y) = (0,10)$ and horizontal intercept $(x, 0) = \left( \displaystyle\frac{10p_y}{p_x}, 0\right)$ Now suppose $p_y$ is increased to $p_y'$.
(Changes in) Hicksian demand is related to the substitution effect from the Slutsky decomposition.
Suppose I have a Marshallian demand function $x_M(p_x^0,p_y,m^0)$. As I understand it, Slutsky compensation is defined as $$T_S = \Delta p_x \cdot x_M(p_x^0,p_y,m^0)$$ Can someone explain why this compensation overcompensates the consumer?
How do I derive the demand function from $$U=y + 2\sqrt{x}$$ Currently I have $MRS = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$, so, $P_y = P_x\sqrt{x}$ Using the budget line: $$I = xP_x + yP_y \implies I = xP_x +y(P_x\sqrt{x})$$ Which simplifies to $$x = \frac{2I + y^2 P_x \pm y\sqrt{Px(4I+y^2P_x)}}{2P_x}$$ I'm not sure if this is correct, should I have did $MRS = \frac{1}{\sqrt {x}} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}$, so, $P_x = \frac{P_y}{\sqrt{x}}$ instead and substitute $\frac{P_y}{\sqrt{x}}$ into budget line?

Ultimately, whilst this game is being played, these memes are also being curated themselves: more tokens bonded to a meme is a signal that is a funnier meme than a meme with fewer bonded tokens.
Note: Here, only $q_t^e$ is the only variable and expected utility function is maximized subject to $q_t^e$ For simplification, I denoted M= (1-$q_t^e$)$w_t$ + $q_t^e$$w_t$$z_t$ This made $C_{1,t}$ = nM and $C_{2,t}$= (ARθ/$z_t$)M I also broke down constraint iii into two constraints $q_t^e$≤1 and -$q_t^e$≤0 I set up the legrange: L = (1-π)[${(nM)}^{-γ}$]/(-γ) + π[${((ARθ/z_t)M)}^{-γ}$]/(-γ) + $λ_1$(1-$q_t^e$) + $λ_2$(0+$q_t^e$) Differentiating with respect to $q_t^e$ (1-π)[${(nM)}^{-γ-1}$][n($z_t$-1)] + π[${((ARθ/z_t)M)}^{-γ-1}$][(ARθ/$z_t$)($z_t$-1)] = $λ_1$ - $λ_2$ $λ_1$(1-$q_t^e$) =0; $λ_1$≥0 $λ_2$(0+$q_t^e$) = 0; $λ_2$≥0 Case 1: $λ_1$=0 and $λ_2$ I got (1-π)[${(nM)}^{-γ-1}$][n($z_t$-1)] + π[${((ARθ/z_t)M)}^{-γ-1}$][(ARθ/$z_t$)($z_t$-1)] =0 Which boils down to M=0 which gave me - - > $q_t^e$ = 1/(1-$z_t$) But solution provided is of the following form - My answer doesn't match the solution provided.

These functions are deterministic algorithms that produce numbers that can pass for random.
For some outcomes random effects are supported, for others fixed are. For the main table of results in my paper would it be acceptable to report the results of the fixed effects models for those outcomes that the Hausman suggests should use a fixed effects estimator and the results of the random effects estimator for those outcomes that a random effects estimator is suggested for?
So if markets can make mistakes, but not in a way that allows anyone to make disproportionate rewards except by random chance, then they can be highly efficient.

We know that Elasticity of Demand Coefficient = Change in Quantity Demanded / Change in Price $x$ If we change price by $x$, how do we get what the change in quantity demanded is if there is no quantity demanded at the new price?
Management sets the quantity of ressources and intermediate goods the striking employees have at their disposal to use as inputs.
Hence, for any change in quantity, $\% \Delta P=0$. $$\epsilon_D=\frac{\% \Delta Q_D}{\% \Delta P}$$ A perfectly elastic demand curve is horizontal, meaning we quantity demanded can change by any amount without changing price (any quantity can be sold at the price corresponding the vertical intercept).
When a change in price results in an infinitely large response in quantity demanded, demand is perfectly elastic.
5, the percentage change in quantity demanded is half the percentage change in price.
This is the same as saying that the market price changes by $dP$ and is why you get the same number.

I’ve been trying to think of social welfare functionals which meet all of Arrow’s conditions–––unrestricted domain, weak Pareto, independence of irrelevant utilities, and non-dictatorship (see this entry for definitions)–––plus (invariance with regard to) absolute-scale full-comparability (AFC).
WARP/SARP differ from GARP in that the former presumes the availability of infinitely many choice data to build a choice function with, whereas GARP only requires a finite set of choice data.
For instance, if $()$ is a linear expected utility function representing a vNM-consistent preference, then $()=[()]^2$ is another utility function representing the same preference, except that it is a non-linear (or non-vNM) expected utility function.
Suppose there are two agents $\{A,B\}$ with the following utility functions: $U_A(x_A,y_A)=x_A+f(y_A)$ and $U_B(x_B,y_B)=x_B+g(y_B)$ $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing and strictly concave.
Jonathan Levin in "Choice under Uncertainty" wrote in Theorem 1 " A complete and transitive preference relation on a set of lotteries P satisfies continuity and independence if and only if it admits as expected utility representation".
Allocation in which A consumes everything and B consumes nothing: $(x_A, y_A) = (1,1)$ and $(x_B, y_B) = (0,0)$ is Pareto efficient, but $y_A \neq y_B$.

The architect writes to the builder suggesting that the profits be divided equally.
These factors are in general not likely to be pecuniary, so they are usually treated as a residual - if MW/COL in state A is less than MW/COL in state B, then the difference must be due to improved amenities in state A.
As you may already know, we can either regress the $(2)$ if we are interested on both $α_i$ and $β_i$ or alternatively we just use the formula $β_i=Cov(R_i,R_m)/Var(R_m)$, because $α$ should be close to zero (transaction costs).

Moreover, evidently $\frac {\partial \hat k^*}{\partial g_x} 0$ so in all $$\frac {\partial \hat c^*}{\partial g_x} 0$$ Therefore, if $g_x \downarrow \implies \hat c^* \uparrow $.
So, by construction, $$X\hat{\beta}+\hat{e}=X\hat{\beta}+y-X\hat{\beta}=y$$. We are replacing $y$ with $\hat{y}+\hat{e}$, which is the fitted value of $y$, given by $X\hat{\beta}$, plus the estimated value of the residual, given by $y-X\hat{\beta}$.
If $X$ is a Giffen good for Steven, then $Y$ must be a normal good for Steven. Steven only consumes two goods: $X$ and $Y$.

In this risk chart they show that XSP has both kinds of risks, because the hedging is imperfect so XSP still has currency risk.
Given a multimarket model for staple agricultural commodities wheat, rice, maize and sorghum, in a low-income economy, Im trying to figure out how I can use the multimarket framework to look at the impacts of bringing in food aid to the economy as well as introducing improved agricultural technologies.
In the chapter 4 of the graduate textbook Lectures on Macroeconomics there is "The Overlapping Generation with Money".
I supposed it was to make things easier, so I checked it: 1 EUR = 1,3280 CAD (2) = 1,3280 CAD = 1 EUR 1 CAD = 0,6691 EUR (3) 1,3280 * 1 CAD = 1,3280 * 0,6691 EUR = 1,3280 CAD = 0.
The interface was similar to this: Action: [ ] Buy [ ] Sell Currency: [ ] CAD [ ] USD So basically, in order to do what I wanted to do (convert CAD to USD), I had 2 options: A) Buy USD B) Sell CAD What's the difference between both actions ?
The jobs gained by recycling are lost from other sectors and the jobs lost are gained.
The wikipedia article about Homothetic preferences however defined a preference to be homothetic, if they can be represented by a utility function and the following is true: $$ u(kx_1, kx_2) = k \cdot u(x_1, x_2)$$ And I am pretty sure, that this is not true for Cobb Douglas preferences: $$ u(kx_1, kx_2) = (kx_1)^a (kx_2)^b = k^{a+b} x_1^a x_2^b \neq k \cdot u(x_1, x_2)$$ So what am I missing here?
I´ve been trying to compute a volatility of invesment with currency hedging and I have a question.
How can volatility swaps be used to reduce the risk of volatility in the markets (hedging strategies)?

q_, firm, q_i, pi_, p_, response, best, profit, dq_, cournot
Then, you solve Firm 1's profit maximization, with Firm 1 correctly anticipating the responses of the subsequent two firms: \begin{equation} \max_{q_1}\; \bigl(16-q_1-q_2^*(q_1)-q_3^*(q_1,q_2)\bigr)q_1.
Let $\pi_1(q_1, q_2), \pi_2(q_1, q_2)$ denotes firm 1's profit and firm 2's profit respectively when firm 1 produces $q_1$ and firm 2 produces $q_2$.
For $j = n$ the best response is given by \begin{align} b_n(Q_{n-1}) = \arg\max_{q_n}(1 - Q_{n-1} - q_n)q_n = \frac{1- Q_{n-1}}{2}.
Likewise, from $(2)$ we get Firm 2's best response to Firm 1's output, $q_2^*(q_1)$.
Case 2: signaling exist Consider the firm 2 $$\pi_2 = max [ (a-q_2-q_1)q_1]$$ By FOC, $q_2=(1/2)[a-q_1]$ Now consider the firm 1, $$\pi_1= max [ (1/2)(ah-q_1^H-q_2)q_1^H+(1/2)(aL-q_1^L-q_2)q_1^L]$$ S.t.
Let me call it $\pi_1(q_1,q_2)=TR-TC=p\cdot q_1-c\cdot q_1$ for firm 1 and $\pi_2(q_1,q_2)=TR-TC=p\cdot q_2-c\cdot q_2$ for firm 2, then to check that P is the potential of this game you want to check that $\frac{\partial P(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_1}=\frac{\partial \pi_1(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_1}$ and that $\frac{\partial P(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_2}=\frac{\partial \pi_2(q_1,q_2)}{\partial q_2}$.
For firm 1, $$\pi_1=max[(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_1-cq_1]$$ FOCs for $q_1$ $$a-2bq_1-bq_2-c=0$$ So $$q_1={a-bq_2-c\over 2b}$$ For firm 2, $$max [(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_2]$$ FOCs $$a-bq_1-2bq_2=0$$ $$q_2={a-bq_1\over 2b}$$ So, $$q_1={a-b({a-bq_1\over 2b})-c\over 2b}$$ $$q_1^*={a-2c\over 3b}$$ And $$q^*_2={5a+2b\over 6b}$$ —- The question says that “* firm 1 maximizes profit and firm 2 maximizes revenue as long as shareholders are satisfied, which he achieves by keeping profits nonnegative.
Incumbent firms face a production cost of $C_i (q_i) = 4q_i$ for $i= 1,2$. All firms face a market price of $P(Q) = 16-q_1-q_2-q_3$.
This is because when $q_2  q_1$, $p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)(q_2 - q_1)  0$ and $c'(q_2) - c'(q_1)  0$, when $q_2  q_1$, $p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)(q_2 - q_1)  0$ and $c'(q_2) - c'(q_1)  0$.
The demand is $p(q) = A − Bq$. My Workings I've tried to solve the problem using the following method: Leader ($q_1$) $$\begin{align} profit(q_1,q_2,q_3) = (A - B(q_1+q_2+q_3))q_1 -cq_1 -F \\  = Aq_1 - B(q_1+q_2+q_3)q_1 -cq_1 -F\\  = Aq_1 - Bq_1^2 - Bq_2q_1 - Bq_3q_1 - cq_1 -F\end{align}$$ The I took the derivative in regards to $q_1$ leaving me with this: $$profit(q_1,q_2,q_3)= A - 2Bq_1 - Bq_2 -Bq_3 -c$$ Finally I just tried finding $q_1$: $$q_1 = \frac{A-C-Bq_2-Bq_3}{2B}$$ To put $q_1$ into the equation and solve it for $q_2$ and then $q_3$ The Problem: The begining of the solution in the answer sheet looks like this: Solution For Stackelberg with two followers, after firm 1 made its move, agents 2 and 3 are making their move simultaneously knowing q1.

j_, composite, neighborhood, tenant, province, bike, sharing, lot, spread, gentrification
At first glance it would appear to be a horrible model: lots of liability, lots of maintenance, lots of criminality and endless opportunity for annoyance through dumped bikes causing inconvenience.
Part of the process of gentrification is that (typically) younger, hipper bohemian types move into a formerly low-rent neighborhood, and in virtue of their mere presence (and those of the businesses they frequent/establish/work at) they make the neighborhood more desirable.

Then, $$ \theta = q^{-1} \left( \frac{c}{J} \right)$$ $$ \frac{W_1}{W_0} = \frac{f(\theta_0)}{f(\theta_1)} = \frac{f \left( q^{-1} \left(\frac{c}{J_1}\right)\right)}{f \left( q^{-1} \left(\frac{c}{J_0}\right)\right)}$$ $J_1  J_0$, hence $\theta_1  \theta_0$ and $W_1  W_0$.

If we consider the definition of a Nash Equilibrium,and carefully consider the strategy sets for each player, we can see there are at least 10 Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria: $$(s_1^*,s_2^*) \in \{(0,8),(1,7),(2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,1),(7,1),(8,0),(8,8-s_1)\}.

It just sounds odd that all along, Harsanyi allows a player's type to be unknown only to other players, but in the end, no matter what, whether you have various types or not, the payoffs must be computed in expectation.
Game trees are a great tool to present dynamic games such as standard sequential-move games with perfect and complete information (player 1 moves first, player 2 observes the move and reacts, and so on), and they can also be used to present games of incomplete information or games of imperfect information.
By randomizing the payoff will be higher, but it will also be the case that with positive probability $y\neq x\neq x'$, since the behavior of all players is stochastically independent.

Consider the stage game in the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma game: The goal is to derive conditions on $\delta$ such that the symmetric tit-for-tat strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium.
Since Player 2's beliefs have changed with respect to game 1, the mixed strategy given by $G$ is, in general, no longer optimal (unless $a$ and $b$ give the same payoff regardless of the action of player 1).

tax, income, wealth, saving, rate, inequality, consumption, government, household, increase
They also find that dropping the wealth taxes didn't change this pattern, however, they attribute this to an "equalizing force": One important confounding reason why wealth inequality has stabilized in Denmark (despite wealth tax cuts) is likely to be the sharp rise of pension wealth, from around 50% of national income in the late 1980s to 178% in 2014.
A major concern is also that a substantial share of the private wealth of the top 1% is invested in productive firms which employ millions of people.
That's why there's an "I" in "IRS": they're the Internal Revenue Service, as opposed to Customs, which collects taxes on external products.
Stamp duty brackets used to be absolute rates: so when the purchase price crossed over the bracket threshold by £1, the marginal rate would be huge, as the whole purchase price was taxed in the higher rate.
However, the personal tax allowance is clawed back at incomes above £100,000 at a 50% rate, so those with incomes above £122,000 don't benefit from the allowance at all.
Exploiting recurring variation in household liquidity, this study shows that when low-income households have more liquidity, they partially catch up to higher-income households’ ability to use intertemporal savings strategies.
Conceptually, as compared to a neutral taxation scheme, a progressive one shifts the tax burden more towards the higher segments of the income distribution, and a regressive one shifts the tax burden more towards the lower segments.
So, to put it succinctly: Denmark has a public policy of taxing high earners in order to subsidize those at the lower end, while public and private pensions (which tend to be much larger than in other developed nations) are of primary benefit to the high earners.

Considering these I think the strategy set of $i$ is $$ S_i={\sf X}^{T-1}_{t=0} A_i^{A^t}.
I think one can make a reasonable argument that going from 1 bedroom (small house) to 2 bedrooms should have a larger impact on the price than going from say 5 bedrooms (large house) to 6 bedrooms because the marginal value of adding an extra bedroom is larger in that case.
By the inverse function theorem, we have $$y = f(k) \implies k = f^{-1}(y) = f^{-1}[f(k)] \implies \frac {\partial f^{-1}(y)}{\partial y} = \frac {1}{f'(k)}$$ Keeping all these relations in mind, we also have $$\dot y = f'(k)\cdot \big[sf(k) - (n+g+\delta)\cdot f^{-1}(y)\big]$$ $$\implies \frac{\partial \dot y}{\partial y} \bigg|_{y=y^*} = \frac {\partial f'(k^*)}{\partial y}\cdot \big[sf(k^*) - (n+g+\delta)\cdot k^*\big]\\ + f'(k^*)\cdot \left[s - (n+g+\delta)\cdot \frac {1}{f'(k^*)} \right]$$ $$\implies \frac{\partial \dot y}{\partial y} \bigg|_{y=y^*} = 0 + sf'(k^*) - (n+g+\delta)$$ etc

Under ordinal utility you can only say that Lisa prefers ice cream to cereal, but you can’t say that she derives let’s say twice as big utility $u$(cerial)=10 and $u$(ice cream)=20.
Ice Cream Peter’s Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Ice Cream Frozen Desserts Desserts For some reason I find this question very subjective.
In turn, as ice cream prices rise, producers make more of it, and thus more skim milk.
Your ice cream shop has some costs that vary depending on how many half-gallon ice cream packages are made, and some benefits, the revenue from selling ice cream.
all ice creams are frozen desserts but not all frozen desserts are ice creams. if you wanted chocolate ice cream but none was available you are more likely to get vanilla ice cream than pork chops.
Is there porn that's targeted at wealthier, paying customers that I am not aware of?
5$ That would make the cost for a single cone with a scoop of vanilla ice cream exactly 1.
Hint 1: So I think you are making a mistake by substituting their production technology into their utility: when you went from $\max 6(1-l_A)+c_A$ to $\max 6(1-l_A)+4l_A$, by doing this, you are assuming that $A$ only consumes what she produces.

First, for clarification, the definition of "change in inventories", taken from page 108 of SNA, version 2008: The basic principle underlying the measurement of changes in inventories of finished goods is that output should be recorded at the time it is produced and valued at the same price whether it is sold, otherwise used or entered into inventories for sale or use later.
But in reality, in order to obtain an actual value for this price index (and hence also of inflation), we must specify a base period, against which we will evaluate the price index for the other periods (past and future).
But when the topic is growth ("how much bigger is it now") the wrong calculation gives incorrect information ("The public debt remained fairly constant from the late 1940s through 1981") and may lead to serious or fatal errors in policy.
GFCF is not a measure of total investment, because only the value of net additions to fixed assets is measured, and all kinds of financial assets are excluded, as well as stocks of inventories and other operating costs (the latter included in intermediate consumption).
I'm trying to predict the income of graduates of certain Master's programs n years after graduation, using the American Community Survey individual level dataset to calibrate my equation.
Obviously, the real value must decrease due to inflation, but I would like to see what is left from the original purchasing power of $1,000 in years-zero every year for 20 years.
My humble opinion is that barring companies owning the shares of other public companies directly or indirectly, there is an upper limit at a fixed discount rate, once the x public companies account for all gdp, it is simply divide that gdp by the discount rate.
The way I have understood is the following: For ROI, since it is negative, therefore the cost of the investment is way higher than the current value investment.

monthly, percentage, f_t, decimal, mdp, formula, zone, target, yearly, expressed
As far as i understand in the Krugman target zone model the following equation describes the behaviour of the exchange rate within and outside a target zone $s_t = f_t + \alpha E_t(ds_t/dt)$.
The monthly payment formula is based on the annuity formula. Since the quoted yearly percentage rate is not a compounded rate, the monthly percentage rate is simply the yearly percentage rate divided by 12; dividing the monthly percentage rate by 100 gives r, the monthly rate expressed as a decimal.
washington. I have been reading from this textbook which talks about CPI and inflation http://faculty.
It uses three factors in production: capital K, which is acquired for price Pk at t=0 and last two periods, and labor in each period, L1 and L2, with respective spot prices PL1 and PL2; the firm acquires L1 at t=0 and L2 at t=1.
So monthly percent should be 0. Why monthly present in on line monthly payment calculator calculated as annual percent divided by 12?
What are the methods to treat the annual figures in to monthly and/or the monthly in to annual?
If not, is there at least a micro theory textbook that heavily focuses on MDP's?
For MDP without considering Microeconomics, (Indeed MDP is a decision-making process.
I make those equal at a monthly discount rate of about $0. 122$, though it does depend on how you translate $10\%$ into a monthly interest payment Similarly for Dealer B, I would have thought the payments were $\$4000$ immediately followed by $36$ equal monthly payments of around $\$522.
So I found this example in the net Compound interest formula (including principal): A = P(1+r/n)(nt) If an amount of $5,000 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded monthly, the value of the investment after 10 years can be calculated as follows...

Apparently Trump had personally promised Tim Cook back in June that Apple phones would not be affected.
Suppose the shock to $n_j$ is totally exogenous for simplicity. Is there a causal framework that allows me to estimate the impact of $n_j=1$?
What are other methods a president could undertake to weaken the dollar? United States president Donald Trump has publicly declared a desire to deflate the value of the dollar.
If ERR > MARR, accept the project, else reject it. ERR is the rate of return of the project when I reinvest the cash produced at a rate RR (Reinvestment Rate).

) we can observe a trend that iPhones on average depreciate far less and slower than for example Samsungs (or other phones that lose their value even faster).
If I were have to pay, I am willing to pay no more than \$5 for such ride. Therefore, I am not willing to pay \$10 for such a ride.

So there appears to be a discrepancy between two different measures of "economic profit".
I would look at the financial economics, financial intermediation, banking, finance, handbooks.
But 'ill add that given that we live on a world economy and the price of gold is fixed by international exchanges betweeen coutries a theoritical calculation of the real price involves currency exchanges and more theory.
If the investors are abroad, they would be less affected by a slow down or a crash or the economy, and thus ask for higher prices to compensate for the risk of defaults.
And there's broader literature on industrial policy and regulation too. Frank Geels of Manchester does a lot of work on the theoretical side of this.
The aggregation of this sort of situation over many households can explain the coexistence of poverty and saving on a significant scale.
In this paper, the first order conditions for capital and labor of the CES production function under cost minimization imply: $$ log(rk/wl) = -(1-\sigma)log(w/r) + (1-\sigma)log B + \sigma log (\alpha / (1-\alpha))$$ This doesn't seem to require any special non-linear estimation technique.
The text of the excerpt does not give the functional form of the depicted curves.

capitalism, industrial, agrarian, keynesianism, mercantilism, revolution, exploitation, century, th, difference
What's the difference between "industrial capitalism" and "agrarian capitalism" and "mercantilism" and the "industrial revolution" and the 20th century ideas of "Keynesianism"?
You are talking about the inverse of the exploitation rate. Surplus value = exploitation rate x use value Wages = (1/exploitation rate) x use value
New Old Keynesianism delineates the differences between Old Old Keynesianism, Old New Keynesianism, New Old Keynesianism and New New Keynesianism such that "New" means “post Global Financial Crisis” and “Old” to refers to a belief that the economy can be in a long-run high unemployment equilibrium.
) How did the creeping inflation linked to the price revolution cause the industrial revolution?
It was the Industrial revolution that divided "work"(e.g. Until the industrial revolution came each household operated like a mini business.
He does sometimes say things that contradict academic Keynesianism. The fact that corporations hoard less cash during recessions doesn't necessarily contradict Keynesianism or New Keynesianism, but it does require these theories to explain why corporations behave this way (which the theorists have not attempted).
Each food worker produces 6 units of food and each clothing worker produces 3 units of clothing.
Put simply, Mercantilism can be enunciated as: Mercantilism focuses on wealth accumulation through extraction of wealth which they believe is measured by the amount of gold bullions that the nation has in its possession.
I can't confirm this is true but it's said by the president of one of the main agrarian organizations of Argentina, probably with statistics made by them and/or data of the national institute of agrarian technology.
But in the present day what theory of value is used for other schools of thought that favor things such as mixed market economies, Keynesianism, socialism, etc ?

money, rate, bank, interest, inflation, would, bond, government, debt, central
Too low, and the opposite happens: sell bonds; less money; less excess reserves; more borrowers; higher interest rates; lower inflation.
Or more aptly, they may believe the only way you can pay this interest is by printing money, decreasing the value of money and potentially leading to inflation or a runaway zimbabwe situation So the destruction of currency reduces the financial liabilities of a central bank, benefitting its balance sheet.
Individuals who wanted to foolishly lend to banks without the backing of the Fed could do so if they REALLY wanted to, but few would as the banking system would burn up in a liquidity fire without Fed support to prop up maturity mismatching by constantly providing artificial levels of short term debt to the banking system.
Now Bank A has an asset: a loan to B Bank A has a liability: Bank A owes money to Bank D Bank D has an asset: Bank A owes money to Bank D Bank D has a liability: C's deposit with Bank D Bank A now needs to settle with Bank D: this can happen through clearing if other customers are moving money to Bank A, but it is easier to imagine that Bank A tells the central bank to give some of A's reserve deposits there to Bank D.
Since banks borrow money from the central bank, they must lend at higher rates than they are borrowing in order to turn a profit, so setting the interest rate is a potent means of encouraging or halting inflation.
Most money only ever exists as accounting transactions, and most money is generally created by regular banks rather than the central bank.
For example, the Federal Reserve "buys" X billion dollars worth of US 30-year T-Bills from JPMorgan by simply taking possession of the T-Bills and credits JPMorgan's deposit account X billion dollars.
Since October 2008, the Fed offers banks 25 basis points per annum for their deposits (including excess deposits over the required reserves), but pays zero interest on deposits from nonbanks, especially GSEs.
I am going to be reluctant to give someone my money for five years if, by the time I get it back, it is worthless—I'd rather spend the money now while it's still worth something.
However, since the private bank is borrowing from the central bank, money is flowing from the private sector back to the central bank, reducing the money supply.

Currency pairs quotes work such that one unit of the base currency can be exchanged for quoted amount of the quote currency (hence the name "quote currency").
So can i use propensity score matching to evaluate this program? But the problem is the program itself (at the first year) implemented to almost all villages across countries.
It makes clear that the "ease" you refer to typically refers to the lack of government restrictions.

Further, if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}[Y|X = x] = \mathop{{}\mathbb{E}}[Y]$.
If $S_Y$ is the amount saved by $Y$ in the first period, and $T_X$ is the amount transferred by $X$ to $Y$ in the second period, then $X$'s payoff as function of his choice $T_X$, taking as given $Y$'s choice $S_Y$ is $$\ln(I - T_X) + a\left(\ln(I-S_Y) + b\ln(S_Y+T_X)\right)$$ $X$ will choose $T_X$ by solving the following problem : $$\max_{T_X \geq 0} \ \ \ln(I - T_X) + a\left(\ln(I-S_Y) + b\ln(S_Y+T_X)\right)$$ First-order condition for optimality is: $$\frac{1}{I-T_X} =\frac{ab}{S_Y + T_X} $$ Solving it for $T_X$ we get, $$T_X = \frac{abI-S_Y}{ab+1}$$ This is the best response transfer function of $X$.

The other way to have multiple states defect in the same period is the interesting case.
As most supplies have in some sense a service and a product component, general zero-rating of services would create huge incentives to artificially split out product and service compoments to save on VAT, leading to huge tax bureaucracy and litigation.

Sometimes, companies that are essentially still under the control of the founders &mdash; even though they have done an initial public offering and are now publicly traded &mdash; will do a secondary offering in which the company itself purchases stock from the founders, and sells that stock on the market, rather than actually issuing new stock.
For as long as I can remember people in the US have complained about the high cost and trajectory of college tuition and healthcare expenditures.
Is there a general rule of thumb in constructing an IC? Suppose we are interested in constructing an incentive compatibility constraint for an agent to announce his state truthfully.

"substitution patterns between exchange transplants and other transplant outcomes" would, I think, be better phrased as "patterns of substitution of exchange for other transplant outcomes".
Suppose (for contradiction) that SR cost curve is above the LR cost curve at point $x$ on LR cost curve.
I didn't work out the proof myself but found in Wikipedia another version of the CES production function that has the same shape as your cost production function by replacing $1-\sigma$ with $r$.
To give some context the author says the following: "I analyze the substitution patterns between exchange transplants and other transplant outcomes" What does this mean in layman terms?
First, in IS LM model where in classical case, when LM curve is vertical increase in government expenditures have no increase in output i.e.
This might be in the form of job change (silica miner move to coal miner), or might be in the form of task redefinition (the book Prediction Machines describe how self-driving school bus might shift the main task of a school bus driver to an adult who oversees and "teaches" the schoolchildren.
Then my costs will be function of both labor $L$ and quantity $Q$. If I have wage $w = 200$ and rental rate $r = 3050$ on short run, I can assume that $K=1$ and then get the total costs $TC = rK+wL = 3050 + 200L$.
I am trying to give a puzzle from behavioral economics illustrating on the irrationality of thinking of costs in proportional rather than absolute terms.
Hence, if $TC(q)$ is the total cost for the given level of quantity $q$, then $FC=TC(0)$ is the fixed cost, which is a constant independent of $q$; and $VC(q)=TC(q)-FC$ is the variable cost.
In the answer to this question, the answerer said "the minimum point of a short run cost curve will be above the long run cost curve".

Applying the chain rule we get: $\frac{\partial \Pi_t}{\partial Y_t(j)}=P_t \left(\int_0^1 Y_t(j)^{1-\nu} \ dj \right)^{\frac{\nu}{1-\nu}} Y_t(j)^{-\nu}-P_t(j)=0$ At this point, the trick of the trade is that $\left(\int_0^1 Y_t(j)^{1-\nu} \ dj \right)^{\frac{\nu}{1-\nu}}$ which is a part of the FOC, equals $Y_t^{\nu}$ (check the first equation) Setting $\left(\int_0^1 Y_t(j)^{1-\nu} \ dj \right)^{\frac{\nu}{1-\nu}}= Y_t^{\nu}$ in the FOC, and solving for $Y_t(j)$ will give the desired result.
As the Frisch elasticity here is given by $\nu$, I would calibrate $\nu$ to be between 0.
In this context, $\nabla_\nu \varphi_\nu(x)$ is a vector of size $n_\nu$. In this case, define the $\nu$-th player's strategy vector $x^\nu \in R^{n_\nu}$ and so $x=(x^1,\dots,x^N)^T$ of a size $n_1+\dots+n_N$ for a $N$ player game.
The startup has a pre-money valuation of 1M. Let's say that the startup, after 1 year, raise a Series A round.
] yields": $$w_t - p_t = \sigma c_t + \varphi n_t + \chi (\nu - \sigma) (c_t - (m_t - p_t))$$ with $\chi = \frac{ \vartheta^{\frac1\nu} (1 - \beta)^{1 - \frac1\nu} }{ (1 - \vartheta)^{\frac1\nu} + \vartheta^{\frac1\nu}(1 - \beta)^{1 - \frac1\nu} }$.
$n$ might be properly measured in units of 15. Consider the leisure part of the utility function: $$ - \alpha \frac{n^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}$$ We can rewrite it like this: $$ - (\alpha^{\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}})^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}} \frac{n^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}} = - \frac{(n\cdot (\alpha^{\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}))^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}} $$ Define $\gamma = (\alpha^{\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}})$ and rewrite the utility function in terms of $\gamma$ instead of $\alpha$ $$ u(c, n) = \log (c) - \frac{(\gamma \cdot n)^{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}}{1 + \frac{1}{\nu}}$$ Written this way, I see $\gamma$ and therefore $\alpha$ as serving as a unit shifter.
Is it possile that central banks are secretly stealing from the economy by printing money when the the dollar deflates, so the dollar stay the same value and nobody notice it?
However, his solution - in (4) - puts $\epsilon (t)$ in the first equation of (2) instead of $\nu (t-1)$, and $\nu (t-1)$ instead of $\epsilon (t)$.

And the results of this paper are not amazing for DSGE: Two forecasting exercises have been implemented on US quarterly economy data: the first one considering a simple forecasting one-step-ahead strategy with different samples, and the second a h-steps ahead evaluation with a rolling forecasting estimation.
To see this, consider the outcomes of the Allais paradox: $$M^T=\begin{bmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\ 1  1  0  0 \\ 1  5  0  0 \\ 1  0  1  0 \\ 1  1  1  0 \\ 1  5  1  0 \\ 1  0  0  5 \\ 1  1  0  5 \\ 1  5  0  5 \\ 1  0  1  5 \\ 1  1  1  5 \\ 1  5  1  5 \end{bmatrix}$$ Where each column represents one of the four gambles.
Or are they just good at "analyzing" the sample(through Granger tests, IRF's etc) and bad out-of-sample forecasters?
I tested 4 different method but without achieving an ARMA-GARCH simulation with my data.
I am awared of the following: Tobit (Tobin, 1958), Two-Stage Model (Heckman, 1979), Two-Parts Model (Duan et al.
That paper has a highly accurate approximation for Tobin's Q using Compustat. If you are interested in Tobin's (average) q, you might find useful A Simple Approximation of Tobin's q (Chung and Pruitt (1994)).
You then compare your forecast predictions to known data and to those of other forecasts.
What about the forecast error. What will be the impact of estimating AR(P-1) on the estimated coefficients of $\phi_1 - \phi_{p-1}$, can they be consistently estimated.
However in population forecasting, can ARIMA models be interpreted in a meaningful way?
They generate different performances (e.g. DSGE models and BVARs are commonly used in academia and policy circles.
