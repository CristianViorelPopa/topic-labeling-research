I use a Dickey-Fuller test to test for stationarity and concluded that both of my series are non-stationary.
I might be wrong but from what you write, it seems you've been given a "classical" introduction to econometrics: You've covered IVs and Diff-in-diff but apparently only in passing, and causal inference does not look like it was the core of the classes you've taken.

Although I am not a macroeconomist, I am confident to say that search models recognized as a key ingredient to explain unemployment in equilibrium.
The other question is whether there is any effect colloquially similar to the 'magical chairs' game in which the latest resident to move into a region of increased popularity will not reap the rewards obtained by the prior residents?

country, rate, currency, exchange, price, export, good, usd, u, foreign
Assuming China has a 30% inflation rate, while USA and Lebanon have 0 inflation rate, then the fact that the inflation rate differential between China and USA is 30%, while the Chinese nominal exchange rate was devalued by only 20%, implies that in real terms, the Chinese currency (relative to both the USD and Lebanese Pound) has actually appreciated by approximately 10%=30%-20%.
Furthermore, before having a deficit, the US has had a surplus for a very long time, so it is natural it would eventually have a deficit.

$$ Then for $\varepsilon^{\prime}$ sufficiently small, $$x - \varepsilon (1, 1) + \varepsilon^{\prime}(-1, 1) \prec x \prec x + \varepsilon (1, 1) + \varepsilon^{\prime}(-1, 1)$$ by continuity (and for small $\varepsilon^{\prime}$ these points are once again contained in $X$).
How can we use the same $\theta$ in the proof while the definition clearly states $u(\theta)\geq \theta q(\theta')-t(\theta'),\forall\theta,\theta'$?

But do not take what i am saying for granted: if you really want to know how abusive maintaining your economic interpretations would be, it's all a matter of visualizing/diagnozing the relative weights of your components.
Let me begin with noting that models such as the CAPM have been extensively falsified, beginning with Mandelbrot in 1963 and ending with the Fama-MacBeth testing in 1973.

You believe that after 2015, there is a stronger incentive to do something different at quarter end, so the average basis should be different on month end days during that period.
Electrical equipment, appliances and components makers noted that the “economy seems to be softening,” adding that “tariffs have caused much confusion in the industry".

airbnb, price, hotel, rental, increase, rent, city, elastic, revenue, omega
Simple supply and demand economics would suggest that the huge increase in the supply of rooms to rent by Airbnb should have reduced the price of rental significantly in those cities where Airbnb is most popular.
We find Airbnb’s presence in a market has a negative effect on hotel occupancy rates, but a positive effect on total hotel revenue and the average daily rate they charge.

The GATS covers four modes of supply: (1) cross-border supply; (2) supply through the movement of consumers to the location of the supplier; (3) supply though the establishment in a country of the commercial presence of legal entities from another country; and (4) the supply through natural persons of one country in the territory of another.
As I understand it countries negotiate free trade agreements in services using the WTO GATS.

fuel, airline, truck, flight, plane, passenger, price, airport, burn, macro
Car prices haven’t gone up due to the majority of auto makers profits being from the truck and SUV market.
Therefore, it might be a case that it is more efficient (or profitable) to take on board more fuel (even if it means that the plane will burn more fuel) than to buy fuel for a higher price, i.e.

Ultimately, whilst this game is being played, these memes are also being curated themselves: more tokens bonded to a meme is a signal that is a funnier meme than a meme with fewer bonded tokens.
To use the marketplace the user however needs to buy company’s tokens. The new users would have to pay high costs (buying the tokens) just to enter the platform.

demanded, quantity, dp, price, dq, change, elasticity, demand, inelastic, perfectly
In this case if the sum of the elasticities equals 1, there has been an improvement in the trade balance, but I would have expected the trade balance to have been unchanged.
We know that Elasticity of Demand Coefficient = Change in Quantity Demanded / Change in Price $x$ If we change price by $x$, how do we get what the change in quantity demanded is if there is no quantity demanded at the new price?

remittance, exclude, bad, individual, unable, noise, com, excludability, public, w_i
For a public good, non-excludability is normally taken to mean that the provider of the good is unable to exclude individuals from benefiting from the good.
And what do you assume the noise is then specifically? When examining how Market Microstructure works and affects price formation, there is talked about the: "Assumed independence of latent price and microstructure noise"

glass, bottle, fund, manager, kahneman, daniel, typical, etf, helping, recycling
I think this Quora discussion on the fund manager illusion of validity told most of the story.
This might explain why you see versions with traditional funds, but not ETFs. Traditional funds (as opposed to ETFs) will always be promoted much more aggressively, because their providers earn high fees.

interval, non, song, succsim, lagged, aggregator, rivalry, riding, offshore, excludability
Yet there is also non-excludability: Even if someone loses the bidding war, they can listen to the song chosen by the other person.

utility, function, preference, individual, choice, axiom, allocation, ordinal, m_, expected
I’ve been trying to think of social welfare functionals which meet all of Arrow’s conditions––-unrestricted domain, weak Pareto, independence of irrelevant utilities, and non-dictatorship.
WARP/SARP differ from GARP in that the former presumes the availability of infinitely many choice data to build a choice function with, whereas GARP only requires a finite set of choice data.

col, weighting, state, wage, mw, iota, r_m, singer, humane, aw
I assume that weighting COL in MW particularly is better than weighting COL in average wage (AW), because, although there are few families with extremely high wages, their wages bias AW extremely upwards, while MW is less effected from such extreme cases.
These factors are in general not likely to be pecuniary, so they are usually treated as a residual - if MW/COL in state A is less than MW/COL in state B, then the difference must be due to improved amenities in state A.

announcement, chapter, ic, state, realized, mwg, agent, compatibility, kehoe, incentive
B introduces IC for truthful implementation Krishna (2010) chapter 5 is similar to the previous MWG chapter, but draws out more implications of IC.
So I've seen this sort of thing where you basically differentiate with respect to each Y_j so the integral drops out (seen this in moral hazard chapter from MWG and Romer's endogenous growth model).

Due to common knowledge, 2 and 3 can reason: "1 knows there is at least one red hat, and since she doesn't know her hat color, 2 and/or 3 must have a red hat.
I do not know that 2 knows that 3 knows there is a red hat. 1 thinks: "If 2 knows 3 sees a red hat, then my hat is red.

risk, xsp, cad, premia, recycling, hedging, manager, preferential, usd, personal
Consequently, much of the literature has focused on explaining conditional currency risk premia by ruling out asymmetries.
In this risk chart they show that XSP has both kinds of risks, because the hedging is imperfect so XSP still has currency risk.

q_, firm, q_i, pi_, p_, response, best, profit, dq_, cournot
Then, you solve Firm 1's profit maximization, with Firm 1 correctly anticipating the responses of the subsequent two firms: \begin{equation} \max_{q_1}\; \bigl(16-q_1-q_2^*(q_1)-q_3^*(q_1,q_2)\bigr)q_1.
Let $\pi_1(q_1, q_2), \pi_2(q_1, q_2)$ denotes firm 1's profit and firm 2's profit respectively when firm 1 produces $q_1$ and firm 2 produces $q_2$.

j_, composite, neighborhood, tenant, province, bike, sharing, lot, spread, gentrification
Part of the process of gentrification is that (typically) younger, hipper bohemian types move into a formerly low-rent neighborhood, and in virtue of their mere presence (and those of the businesses they frequent/establish/work at) they make the neighborhood more desirable.
At first glance it would appear to be a horrible model: lots of liability, lots of maintenance, lots of criminality and endless opportunity for annoyance through dumped bikes causing inconvenience.

kkt, condition, ii, maximum, global, coal, qualification, theorem, slater, marriage
Indeed, the KKT conditions (i) and (ii) cannot be necessary---because, we know (either by Weierstrass, or just by inspection as you have done) a solution to (*) exists while (i) and (ii) has no solution in g ≤ 0.
Well done for spotting this one. Then the maximum of this expression is the maximum of -C (Cost) which is equivalent to the minimum of C, and the equivalence with maximum profit holds under duality.

player, game, strategy, equilibrium, payoff, probability, t_, nash, theta, action
If we consider the definition of a Nash Equilibrium,and carefully consider the strategy sets for each player, we can see there are at least 10 Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria.
It just sounds odd that all along, Harsanyi allows a player's type to be unknown only to other players, but in the end, no matter what, whether you have various types or not, the payoffs must be computed in expectation.

tax, income, wealth, saving, rate, inequality, consumption, government, household, increase
They also find that dropping the wealth taxes didn't change this pattern, however, they attribute this to an "equalizing force".
A major concern is also that a substantial share of the private wealth of the top 1% is invested in productive firms which employ millions of people.

Technology C, which has a lifetime of 25 years. Technology B, which has a lifetime of 20 years.

ice, cream, participant, reward, tau, cereal, time, rl, l_a, varepsilon_
Under ordinal utility you can only say that Lisa prefers ice cream to cereal, but you can’t say that she derives let’s say twice as big utility $u$(cerial)=10 and $u$(ice cream)=20.
In turn, as ice cream prices rise, producers make more of it, and thus more skim milk.

year, gdp, value, data, variable, would, price, capital, time, growth
For example, in the release notes for quarterly GDP of the US economy (see link above), towards the end there is a section called "Updates to GDP".
But in reality, in order to obtain an actual value for this price index (and hence also of inflation), we must specify a base period, against which we will evaluate the price index for the other periods (past and future).

monthly, percentage, f_t, decimal, mdp, formula, zone, target, yearly, expressed
The monthly payment formula is based on the annuity formula. Since the quoted yearly percentage rate is not a compounded rate, the monthly percentage rate is simply the yearly percentage rate divided by 12.
So monthly percent should be 0. Why monthly present in on line monthly payment calculator calculated as annual percent divided by 12?

What's the difference between "industrial capitalism" and "agrarian capitalism" and "mercantilism" and the "industrial revolution" and the 20th century ideas of "Keynesianism"?
You are talking about the inverse of the exploitation rate. Surplus value = exploitation rate x use value Wages = (1/exploitation rate) x use value

money, rate, bank, interest, inflation, would, bond, government, debt, central
Too low, and the opposite happens: sell bonds; less money; less excess reserves; more borrowers; higher interest rates; lower inflation.
Or more aptly, they may believe the only way you can pay this interest is by printing money, decreasing the value of money and potentially leading to inflation or a runaway zimbabwe situation So the destruction of currency reduces the financial liabilities of a central bank, benefitting its balance sheet.

Assume that the confidence the board does not reduce and neither does it ability to maintain USD reserves.
Currency pairs quotes work such that one unit of the base currency can be exchanged for quoted amount of the quote currency (hence the name "quote currency").

carbon, vat, fee, strictly, prefers, price, year, indifferent, map, value
As most supplies have in some sense a service and a product component, general zero-rating of services would create huge incentives to artificially split out product and service compoments to save on VAT, leading to huge tax bureaucracy and litigation.
For example, if a hairdresser cuts your hair, there were no intermediate persons in this process and the cost of the hair cutting service didn't rise because of them.

For as long as I can remember people in the US have complained about the high cost and trajectory of college tuition and healthcare expenditures.
Sometimes, companies that are essentially still under the control of the founders even though they have done an initial public offering and are now publicly traded will do a secondary offering in which the company itself purchases stock from the founders, and sells that stock on the market, rather than actually issuing new stock.
