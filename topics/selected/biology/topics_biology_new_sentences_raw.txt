Lab tests for IgG may be increased in multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, MGUS, lymphoma, CLL, sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, autoimmune diseases, parasitic diseases, chronic infection, and intrauterine contraceptive diseases.
Inflammation (again, broadly speaking) is associated with the 'innate' immune response - this is the immediate response by neutrophils and macrophages (among others), and these cells release a variety of molecules designed to damage cells around them.

According to Laura Dean (Blood Groups and Red Cell Antigens): ABO antibodies in the serum are formed naturally.
The absorption through the skin as iodine and elimination by the kidneys are the reasons for the prescribing precautions: Use with caution in patients with burns (excess absorption) Use with caution in patients with renal impairment (impaired excretion) Use with caution in patients with thyroid disorders (taken up by the thyroid) This case report of Iodine toxicity following prolonged povidone iodine administration is available on pubmed central.
Immunosuppression is not used in cancer, in fact it is typically harmful unless of course the cancer is a immune or white blood cell cancer where suppressing their growth may be helpful.
These cytokines include mainly interleukin (IL) 1 (IL-1α and IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (Dantzer, 2009; Plata-Salamán, 1998).
Some water can come through the stomach and can be absorbed in the small intestine in about 5 minutes; the entire liter may need more than 2 hours (sweatscience.

On the other hand, Gram negative bacteria, due to a thinner peptidoglycan layer cannot retain crystal violet as well and are more likely to retain safranin.
I'm assuming that the crystal violet complexes that are retained in the gram positive bacteria's peptidoglycan layers end up being washed away (perhaps from overdehydrtation).
Gram staining procedure The procedure involves staining the cells with a crystal violet dye.
The gram positive have negative components in the peptidoglycan layer in the form of teichoic acid phosphodiester bonds, and the gram negative have negative components in their outer membrane in the form of lipopolysaccharide.
Is such a list of non-pathogenic gram-negative bacteria's available? In the category of Gram-negative bacteria, is there any non-pathogenic species?
Decoloring will remove the stain on the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria.
The gram positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer on top of the cell membrane, the gram negative bacteria have a lipid layer on the outside followed by a thin peptidoglycan layer and then the cell membrane.
In Gram-postive bacteria, the cell wall is thicker and has much more peptidoglycan compared to Gram-negative bacteria.
I also understand why gram-pos appear purple, --that the crystal violet-iodine complex is retained due to thicker cell walls in gram-pos.....
Lysozyme attacks peptidoglycan, which are found in Gram-positive bacteria. Can lysozyme lyse all bacteria, independently of their Gram status?

gel, buffer, band, sample, run, electrophoresis, sd, agarose, solution, running
For gel electrophoresis of DNA, we use TAE or TBE. TAE buffer is cheaper than TBE but it has low buffering capacity; it exhausts faster than TBE buffer and there is a need to change the buffer during gel electrophoresis when electrophoresis longer.
What is role of EDTA in sample buffer for protein separation for SDS-PAGE. In sample buffer preparation we add EDTA, but if SDS-PAGE is for protein then is it necessary to add EDTA in sample buffer?
What is the role of glycine in the running buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis?
When you set such gel plates horizontally, how do you load samples? When you stand general agarose gel vertically, the gel is slippery coming out from the bottom; although, some run vertically.
0M Tris in stacking gel)? 5M Tris in resolving gel and 1. Why do we use two different concentrations of Tris (i.e.
5% agarose gel: mix 0. 5% agarose gels in TBE pre-stained with gelred. I run the gel in a 1x TBE buffer at around 120 volts.
8ml and sample buffer(2X) 0. 2ml for my sample preparation in SDS PAGE. my protein sample concentration is 4.
Sodium boric acid: a Tris-free, cooler conductive medium for DNA electrophoresis.
when we make agarose gel, we add Etbr before its solidification but we do not add Etbr when the native PAGE gel is in liquid form, why ?
Why does the SDS-PAGE gel always runs vertically, and agarose gel runs horizontally?

etbr, cyp, ferritin, sedimentation, tuna, lithium, clarithromycin, baltic, mag, confocal
For your information thyroglobulin is 650kDa whereas ferritin is 440kDa. There seems to be some confusion regarding the sedimentation rate of ferritin.
Clarithromycin inhibits CYP3A. I've read on this publication that every drug that induces CYP3A can reduce the effectiveness of clarithromycin.
The important relationship between CYP3A induction and clarithromycin discussed in the paper is not that it reduces the effectiveness of clarithromycin, but that CYP3A induction does not overcome clarithromycin mediated CYP3A inhibition.
we add Etbr within the agarose gel but we do not add Etbr directly in native PAGE ?
A lot of the tuna we see in tuna cans in supermarkets comes from the stocks in the Indian ocean, but it is possible to have fresh tuna from the Baltic.
The problem is, that we live in Gdańsk, by the south-eastern side of the Baltic sea and I have never heard of tuna in the Baltic.
I'm trying to empirically calculate the approx final magnification (mag) of digital images rendered through our confocal microscope.
Sedimentation values of thyroglobulin and ferritin containing iron are 19S [1] and 51S [2], respectively.
Does hemoglobin get sourced from ferritin? Is it possible for a person to be low on ferritin but normal on hemoglobin?
Also, what is the most common way to monitor lithium levels in the body? I was reading in my pharmacology textbook on lithium in treating bipolar disorder, and I was curious to know if there was any specific action lithium takes to produce symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia.

The diastole consist of this: atrioventricular valves open, atria contract (atrial systole), blood flows from the atria to the ventricles, the atrioventricular valves close.
For further investigation into the progress of the blood pressure, we will measure a patient's blood pressure in the superior vena cava measured during inhalation and during an exhalation.
I am either thinking hydrostatic pressure of interstitial fluid (because it increases interstitial fluid volume) or hydrostatic pressure of capillary (because it is also increased plasma volume).
Also the arterioles have an even larger lumen than the arteries so shouldn't the capillaries have a larger blood pressure than them as well?
I understand that the venous blood from the brain drains into the dural venous sinuses (which further drains into external jugular vein).
I understand it increases the air inside there which makes my volume louder, what happens after that, do my ears gradually readjust back to the air pressure that they were before?
Therefore, shouldn't the filtration fraction change minimally due to the rise in GFR counteracting the fall in blood flow?
In practice, when you have vasoconstriction of the glomerular capillaries and subsequently an increase in blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate increases.
Also, I think (3) thromboembolism can occur and also (1) organisation of thrombus.
However, this doesn't explain why the atrial pressure is slightly greater than ventricle pressure during filling; it also doesn't explain why the aortic pressure is slightly greater than the ventricle pressure near the end of ejection.

When I started shaving with a razor, the hair growth thickened. If a razor cuts only the hair, then how does hair thicken and become more rough with a razor shave and not after one using a trimmer?
I suspect that a straightening iron simply disrupts the present disulfide bonds, but I'm only speculating.
Why is it that the scalp hair greys first? But it seems like it is the scalp hair that becomes grey first.
Gretchen Schwartz: Iron. Walter White: The soul? Gretchen Schwartz: What about the soul?
Why are these hairs thicker? What causes them to grow differently than the hair on our head?
But, even with straight hair and more symmetrical disulphide bonds, you already have some curling and buckling of the protofibrils, but the hair doesn't curl on a macroscopic level.
Similar to the differences between curly and straight hair, different hairs have different hair follicles.
New disulfide bonds form so the keratin molecules are locked into the shape of the curls.
Shaving damages hair follicles and they become inflamed. One could get an infection JUST by shaving because tissue is ripped from the hair follicles.
Head hair and eyebrows may exhibit balding, but not ear, arm, nose, and facial hair (etc).

It increases the understanding of the classification of the different neurons, but you will inevitably encounter shady areas where things fall apart; consider the fact that the retina is often regarded to be a part of the CNS, because of its embryonic development (Purves, 2002).
For example, if a vesicle was being transported from the plasma membrane to the Golgi and then to the ER, the first part of this journey would be along the plus end to the minus end of the microtubule, carrier by dyneins; the second part of the journey from Golgi to ER would be from minus and to plus and and therefore carried by kinesis.
Since lactate dehydrogenase has pyruvate as a substrate, the equilibrium of this reaction will be pushed to the right and lactate will be formed: Source: wikipedia page on lactate dehydrogenase The lack of glucose oxidation takes away the main power supply of aerobic organisms, causing fatigue.
Here is an image on rod and cone distributions on the retina, showing a high cone-density in the fovea and a high rod density more eccentrically: Source: Webvision And here is an image showing the higher light sensitivity of rods over cones: Source: Webvision Hence, peripheral vision is more light sensitive because: (1) there are more rods in the peripheral retina; (2) rods are more light sensitive; and (3) eccentric retinal rod circuitry further amplifies the rod responses.
After light passes through the lens system of the eye and then through the vitreous humor, it enters the retina from the inside of the eye (see Figure 51-1); that is, it passes first through the ganglion cells and then through the plexiform and nuclear layers before it finally reaches the layer of rods and cones located all the way on the outer edge of the retina.
(2) Does the RGB color scheme give a better color range than, say, a "yellow-green-blue" scheme (which would more closely correspond to the actual cone sensitivities) simply because red is at one end of the visible spectrum, so you can more easily get a wide color range?
Source: Davidson College The millions of different color hues that we can perceive are generated by the retina and the brain by mixing colors and adding the weight that each cone class adds to the color percept (Fig.
So firstly, the palisade layer consists of closely packed cylindrical/rectangular cells, while the spongy layer has loosely packed cells with many air pockets.
The reason why I think a is correct is that sunlight is used during photosynthesis and b because the hydrogen of $NADPH$ produced during light phase is used to combine with $CO_2$ by utilizing ATP (which again was produced in the light phase ) to make $C_6H_{12}O_6$ in the presence of enzyme Rubisco.
This happens during the light dependent stage of photosynthesis, (there is also a second light-independent stage called the Calvin cycle, and that is where the CO$_2$ is used), I won't go into detail about what the protons and electrons do (unless you want me to) but you need to know that these come from a water molecule, the water is split using light (photolysis, literally: cutting with light) into two hydrogens and half an oxygen molecule (or an oxygen atom).

Linkage disequilibrium $\left(D\right)$ for two bi-allelic loci is defined as: $$D=X_{11}X_{22} - X_{12}X_{21}$$ where $X_{11},\ X_{12},\ X_{21},\ X_{22}$ are the frequencies of the haplotypes $A_1B_1$, $A_1B_2$, $A_2B_1$, $A_2B_2$ respectively (the subscript number correspond to the two different alleles and $A$ and $B$ correspond to the two different loci) My questions are How is $D$ defined for more loci and a greater number of alleles?
In consequence, we have four different possible haplotypes $A_1B_1$, $A_1B_2$, $A_2B_1$, $A_2B_2$, which frequencies are $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, $X_4$ respectively.

3 mol-1) [Frey,  Arabshahi, 1995], also considerably more negative that that for the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and Pi Specifics The standard free energy of hydrolysis ($\Delta G^{'o}$) of the $\alpha$,$\beta$-phosphoanhydride of ATP to give AMP and PPi is about - 45 to -50 kJ mol-1 The standard free energy of hydrolysis of the $\alpha$,$\beta$-phosphoanhydride of ADP to give ADP and Pi is about -30 to -34 kJ/mol The standard free energy of hydrolysis of the $\beta$,$\gamma$-phosphoanhydride of ATP to give ADP and Pi is about -32 to -36 kJ/mol.
In ATP we have two anhydride bonds, each with a Standard Gibbs free energy of hydrolysis ~ -30 kJ / mol and one phosphoesterbond of ~ -20 kJ/ mol, if my notes are correct.
5 kJ/mol, with a change in free energy of 3. [17] The energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (Pi) or pyrophosphate (PPi) unit from ATP at standard state of 1 M are:[18] ATP + H 2O → ADP + Pi ΔG° = −30.
This is an endergonic reaction and the energy is supplied to this reaction by another reaction which has to be exergonic reaction i.e.
ADP has two phosphate groups, and can be hydrolysed to AMP in a reaction which involves a similar free energy change to that of hydrolysing ATP to ADP.
&Delta;G=&Delta;H - T&Delta;S where: T= temperature G = Gibbs free energy H = enthalpy S = entropy
The second reaction is then driven by the hydrolysis (breakdown) of ATP, which releases energy.
We know that bond formation releases energy and bond break absorbs energy. I still don't figure out why ATP hydrolysis (that breaks a bond between oxygen and phosphorous) releases energy, and it releases a LOT.
What is the amount of this energy? Edit 1: I know how much free energy (∆G) is released with the hydrolysis of ATP, but I dont know how much energy is needed to start the hydrolysis of ATP.
that the reaction is spontaneous or thermodynamically favorable. You may have seen the criteria for the thermodynamic favorability of a reaction in terms of Gibbs Free Energy: $$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S\leq0$$ That is, for a reaction to be favorable, the change in Gibbs free energy from the initial state (glucose) to the final state (carbon dioxide, water, and energy) must be negative.

We hold regular elections to determine who these community moderators will be. Community moderators are accorded the highest level of privilege on our community, and should themselves be exemplars of positive behavior and leaders within the community.
F1 females are then mated to males that have red bristles and shiny eyes to produce F2 progeny.
Also, moving forward the new ENCODE DCC has taken over curation of archival modENCODE metadata.

MTHFR (methylene-THF reductase) converts CH2-THF into CH3-THF. The carbon group can occur in various redox states: CH3-THF (methyl-THF), CH2-THF (methylene-THF), CH-THF (methenyl-THF) or CHO-THF (formyl-THF).
Eutherians are placental mammals, so all eutherians are placental mammals, but not all mammals are eutherians.
Therefore, the variance of $P_n$ is $$var(P_n) = \sum f_{G_i} (P_{G_i} - \bar P_n)^2$$.
These are two examples of eutherians outcompeting marsupials. I know, not the same as monotremes.
Why are monotremes so rare? Additionally, I read a science article claiming that competition from marsupials essentially forced monotremes into the water, where marsupials couldn't follow without drowning their young.
I am wondering how the body uses folate and B-12 (cobalamine) normally and how the recessive MTHFR genes interfere with this process.

On analysing $\mathbb{E}[\delta_{i,j}\delta_{k,l}]$, we see that if both genotypes are equal, which occurs with probability $\Delta$, then this reduces to $\sigma_D^2$.
For example the word "fantastic" we use upper teeth and lower lip to produce F sound, instead of using lower teeth and upper lip, which would work as well with a small practice.

From what I read on Wikipedia, all functions of the gluteus minimus are mirrored by the gluteus medius.
Where does the gluteus medius attach to the greater trochanter of the femur compared to the gluteus minimus attachment?
So the pangolin scales are a new feature that arose somewhere on the lineage leading to pangolins.
I have read the following two terms in an MRI report (both points refer to the insertion of gluteus medius/minimus to greater trochanter of the femur): mild degeneration of the muscular attachment of the left gluteus medius mild tendinosis of the left gluteus minimus Is muscular attachment (to a bone) synonymous to tendon?

Mumps encephalitis: return with a vengeance. It obviously can do that, causing a rubella encephalitis.
Botulinum toxin is the neurotoxin protein created when botulism spores grow. There are well documented incidents of botulism in horses who are eating hay, all the references I found were centered around hay in large plastic wrapped bales.
If they exist, what is an example of a CCB neurotoxin? What animals use CCB neurotoxins as a weapon / defense tool?
Can Rubella pass into the brain stem? Some studies are made about Rubella associated hemolysis.
The sensitivity of Clostridium botulinum to oxygen is one possible explanation, but it would seem to me that there should be enough anaerobic environments that Clostridium botulinum should be able to flourish anyway.
The specific activity of MYOBLOC (botulinum toxin type b) ranges between 70 to 130 Units/ng.
The infamous Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum, a very powerful toxin that can cause total body paralysis in very small amounts.

On it it is written: Chromosomal formula 46,XX,del(7)(q11q36)[12]/46,XX[13] I understand that 46 is the number of chromosomes, XX refers to the pair of sexual chromosomes, del(7)(q11q36) means a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 7 spanning the bands 11 to 36.
An realistic model of your ancestry is more likely to be (highly idealized and compacted): x x x xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx x x x (you) The issue we are discussing here is actually known as pedigree collapse, where you will eventually find overlap between your ancestors, which will mean that the pedigree collapses instead of growing exponentially.

I know that the coelom is derived from mesoderm. I know for sure that the coelom develops within gastrulation and organogenesis, since it is forming from mesoderm.
In broad way we call it sperm but the motile sperm is precisely called spermatozoon and plural form of spermatozoon is spermatozoa.

There is an increase by abstinence. Lengthy sexual abstinence was found to affect all semen characteristics.
In humans, the coelom forms, amongst others, the pleural cavity. So, yes: humans do have a coelom that partitions into different, unconnected body cavities during development.

I wonder how can semen use di/tri-saccharide (e.g. sucrose, trehalose, raffinose) for spermatozoa metabolism in preservation/cryopreservation of livestock semen, since the semen itself never bring any enzyme to breakdown those sugars and the extender used also don't contain enzyme needed?

A role for intestinal microbiota in TMAO production from dietary carnitine was first suggested by studies in rats; moreover, while TMAO production from alternative dietary trimethylamines has been suggested in humans, a role for microbiota in production of TMAO from dietary L-carnitine in humans had not yet been demonstrated30-32.

Does it mean hatching asynchrony has fitness benefits? Or does it mean hatching asynchrony is likely to be selected for?
What is the bulk modulus of spider silk? What is the shear modulus of spider silk?
8 (fittest genotype - fitness of weakest), likewise $s_f$ is either 0. This paper uses two equations to explain the different conditions under which sexually antagonistic genetic variance is maintained in a population, while allowing for unequal dominance, for autosomally linked loci: $h_f / 1-h_m + h_fs_f $ $ $ $ s_m/s_f  1-h_f/h_m(1-s_f)$ And X-chromosome linked (X-linked) loci: $2 h_f / 1+h_f s_f  $ $ $ $ s_m/s_f  $ $ $ $2(1-h_f)/1-h_f s_f$ where $s_m$ and $s_f$ are the selection coffecients against the less fit homozygote (or hemizygote) in males and females respectively where the most fit genotype has a relative fitness of 1.
In this case, hatching asynchrony merely correlates with fitness, but does not cause fitness to increase and is thus not adaptive.

How does exposure of fish to microplastic particles decrease egg-hatching and give young fish a craving for them?
In 'synchronous hatching' all the eggs hatch at more or less the same time. You see that this is the same as beeing selected for because on average the number of agents passing their genes to the next generation is higher with asynchronous hatching than with synchronous hatching.
In the case of a french fry from say, McDonalds. If, in your own kitchen, you were take a fresh potato, cut it into fries, and cook them in oil long enough to nearly dehydrate the fry, it would not spoil either in a dry environment.

antibiotic, resistance, resistant, penicillin, staphylococcus, aureus, grid, ccr, lactamase, methicillin
Since antibitiotic resistance is causee by transduction of the F factor, is it possible to induce a F+ non antibiotic resistant bacteria into a region of F- resistant bacteria?
FMRSA (meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) became resistant to penicillin by a change in its DD-transpeptidase.
I understand bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics due to selection pressures, but how do resistant bacteria process antibiotics when exposed to it, compared to non-resistant bacteria.
There are three mechanisms: prevention of the interaction between antibiotic and the target PBP; modification of the binding of the antibiotic to the PBP; hydrolysis of the antibiotic by a beta-lactamase.
Among 200 CoNS isolates, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species (87) followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus (23), Staphylococcus hominis (19), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (18), Staphylococcus capitis (15), Staphylococcus xylosus (10), Staphylococcus warneri (8), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5), Staphylococcus lentus (5), Staphylococcus simulans (4), Staphylococcus chromogenes (3), Staphylococcus cohnii (1), Staphylococcus schleiferi (1), and Staphylococcus auricularis (1).
its MIC is increased to methicillin, but not to penicillin b. methicillin-resistance is associated with production of β-lactamases c.
I know that bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics. I only hear about antibiotic resistance, so my assumption was that antiseptic resistance isn't a thing that happens.
Methicillin-resistant staphylococci. J Clin Microbiol. Detection of borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and differentiation from methicillin-resistant strains.
Antibiotic Resistance Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of an antibiotic.
Culture supernatants different organisms , which are suspected to be penicillin-resistant, were obtained and were assayed for &beta;-lactamase activity.

tapeworm, proglottids, would, water, saginata, dna, like, body, one, also
I think a tapeworm is your best bet. For tapeworms specifically, I found this textbook, Animal Physiology: From Genes to Organisms, which claims: Active facultative anaerobes include some parasitic worms such as tapeworms that can survive without oxygen indefinitely...
Proglottids are Hermaphrodite when mature. There can be 1000-2000 Proglottids in the worm body.
For more information see this CDC webpage and this article: "Biochemistry and physiology of tapeworms.".
These two parts represent different species of tapeworms in the same stage of their developments.
Probably the most dangerous tapeworms for humans are Echinococcus. In humans they form cysts (in a variety of organs including brain) [it's because humans are "interpreted" as intermediate hosts], which can become very large and can cause death when untreated or disrupted.
I suspect that the pork sold at a certain shop is infected with the parasite pork tapeworm (Taenia solium).
The proglottids are 5 x 10 mm with a 7-12 branch uterus. It has a long flat body with several hundred segments (proglottids).
The confusion here is quite common (at least it was quite common among my students): the "segments" in a tapeworm like Teania, properly called proglottids, are not really segments, or metamers.
I assume that by internal parasites you mean animals like tapeworms etc? All they need is a certain amount of heat and humidity (which any host provides) and food pre-digested by the host, which is essentially the same for host species that share the same feeding habits, so there is no reason a priori for them to have a narrow range of hosts.
Swine and pigs have over a dozen parasites within them, eg tapeworms, flukes, worms, and trichinae.

This answer is correct, I just wanted to add that the correct sequence numbering is preserved in the PDB file in the DBREF record (which you can see by opening the PDB in a text editor): DBREF 3NOS A 66 492 UNP P29474 NOS3_HUMAN 66 492 In plain English, the sequence presented in this file (3NOS chain A) corresponds to residues 66 - 492 of the associated UniProt (UNP) entry (accession: P29474).
However, it is not obvious to me what the Pectoralis Major has to do with extending the arm.
Guanidine isothiocyanate, which is usually used for RNA isolation, absorbs at 230nm, so that might be what you see.
The pectoralis muscle attaches to the top to the inner half of the clavicle, just underneath the biceps on the inner part of your arm and the breastbone (a.k.
The thing is, in the manual it says to use 8M Guanidine-HCl, pH 1. I have isolated my RNA with TRIzol which also contains Guanidine salt but the concentration is not that high.
First of all, we adjust DNA binding conditions by adding a buffer which includes Guanidine-HCl and ethanol and then we centrifuge our sample.

Any shallower, and the lungs expand, making it positively buoyant. Under this model, for a given amount of air taken in at the surface, the animal has a very specific depth D at which it is neutrally buoyant.
This is for xDNA, I would assume that xRNA behaves comparably if double-stranded.
xDNA came next (also from the Kool lab. 128: 14704-14711 As seen in this Figure from the paper, xDNA consists of an 8 base system A,C,G,T,xA,xC,xG,xT.
Presumably, these are close to neutrally buoyant (though the fact that dead whales sink suggests that they're slightly negatively buoyant).
Many papers describe the, at least, partial success in replicating xDNA and yDNA, as well as transcribing them, as suggested here.

latin, adjective, noun, singular, suffix, masculine, nominative, genitive, tubercle, declension
Tuber is the latin word for tuberosity. They are adjective suffixes. They are both nominative nouns.
Lateralis has the masculine, singular suffix of the nominative 3rd declension. Let's break down each of these anatomical structures to understand the agreement-induced inflections [Source]: os cuneiforme laterale - each of these words is neutral/singular: os = noun, declension 3, nominative, neutral, singular cuneiforme = adjective, declension 3, neutral, singular laterale = adjective, declension 3, nominative, neutral, singular nervus cutaneus antebrachii lateralis - the 2 adjectives match the masculine/singular noun they describe: nervus = noun, declension 2, nominative, masculine, singular cutaneus = adjective, declension 2, nominative, masculine, singular antebrachii = noun, declension 2, genitive, singular lateralis = adjective, declension 3, nominative, masculine, singular Note: you see a shift to the genitive case for antebrachii because in this instance this phrase means "Lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
Here are some suffixes I want to know their meaning: -ium: trapezium (carpal bone) -ius: trapezius (column muscle) -ous: Talous and calcanous (tarsal bone) -alis: Acromialis, Ulnaris (shoulder proccess and bone of forearm) -ate: Capitate, Hamate, lunate (carpal bones) What is the difference between tuber and tubercle?
If you want to say "water way" in ancient Greek, you have to use nominative+genitive, not nominative+nominative, but there might be also euphonic reasons to why is not *hydrohode.
I'm trying to learn the latin names of anatomical entities and I have a hard time remembering whether it's "Os cuneiforme laterale" or "Os cuneiforme lateralis".
1 has: The name of a family is a plural adjective used as a noun; it is formed from the genitive singular of a name of an included genus by replacing the genitive singular inflection (Latin -ae, -i, -us, -is; transcribed Greek -ou, -os, -es, -as, or -ous, and its equivalent -eos) with the termination -aceae (but see Art.
That looks more like Dog Latin than Classical Latin: just tack a few Latinate-looking suffixes to words that cannot be decoded using any known roots from Greek or Latin.
I can not find an on-line Latin translator that works - and not all scientific names are Latin.
Genera are usually given in singular, so what is the correct plural of Dibamus?
So in Italian you will say una Liliacea for the singular and due Liliacee for the plural, while in French it would be une Liliacée and deux Liliacées respectively.

With respect to myc, it can refer to the family of MYC transcription factor proteins (of which, c-Myc, L-myc and N-myc are members).
So, we actually do not have oncogenes. Instead we have proto-oncogenes. Also, these can change to oncogenes any time.
The first is the co-regulation of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in pigmentation by SOX10 and PGC1a/b.
In Burkitt's lymphoma myc escapes this regulation because of a chromosomal translocation, tipping the regulatory balance over to uncontrolled cell growth.
get_from_string(newick, 'newick') pruned = tree. Trees do have a "prune" method, but it prunes a single node from the tree.
Some can be changed into oncogenes by a point mutation that alters the ability of the proto-oncogene to be switched off.
My concern is the disruption of the c-myc/anti-myc Ab interaction due to the fact that c-myc being fused on both ends.
If PFR is the biologically active one why didn't evolution just make one pigment, PFR.
tumor suppressor genes dominant; proto-oncogenes recessive)? Since only one mutation is necessary to turn a proto-oncogene into an oncogene; while two are needed for the malfunctioning of tumor suppressor genes, why is this not the other way around (i.e.

nicotine, bead, leech, silica, bleach, cigarette, tar, lengthening, catnip, smoke
In a study on cigarette stains, the author speaks of tobacco-tar stains, implicitly acknowledging it is tar and not nicotine (John et al.
This did work well, but I found that upon adding water to the silica beads, quite a few of the silica gel beads cracked, this was from the silica gel beads absorbing water fast.
Is there any scientific proof that cigarette smoke (or the nicotine inside it) is a damaging fator for face skin?
Because cigarette smoke contains many carcinogens. Wikipedia has a list of those present in cigarette smoke, which includes classics such as lead, benzene, and formaldehyde, not to mention radioactive polonium.
) You smell the other components of cigarette smoke. You don't smell carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke.
Cigarette smoke contains far more tar than nicotine, and tar will deposit on most-any surface (at ambient temperatures), so it's parsimonious to proceed with the "mostly tar" explanation.
Biokids also points out that leeches will eat other leeches. However, it is possible to eat leeches.
Why do they insert CO2 to the bottle artificially in cases the bottle doesn't have a cork ?
Some solutions contain a mixture of nicotine and flavorings, while others release a flavored vapor without nicotine.

hydrophobia, rheobase, population, would, example, human, like, individual, also, time
So rabies and hydrophobia are distinct and hydrophobia is a symptom of rabies. The person may have hydrophobia.
My question is what the difference is between rheobase and threshold? Rheobase is defined as "the minimum strength (voltage) of stimulus which can excite the tissue".
The rheobase is the horizontal asymptote. The difference is the fact that the rheobase is an example of a threshold measure.
The hydrophobia was secondary to this concern. You are correct that hydrophobia is often considered pathognomonic of rabies.
Hydrophobia as symptom during Rabies. But how could water prevent it? As I think virus always create favorable environment for himselve (for reproduction).
The hydrophobia symptom is most likely a bi-product of the effects the virus has on the brain and not an evolutionarily derived strategy to create an appropriate environment to reproduce in.
Rabies causes hydrophobia in the encephalitic stage which means when it affects the brain and causes swelling and inflammation of multiple areas of the brain.
One of the terrible symptoms of this disease is Hydrophobia(fear of water). If a virus being inanimate did it, why can't a rock or any other aimless non-living thing do it?
Using the lac operon and IPTG enables you to switch on the expression of the gene on your plasmid and to start the overexpression.

When $r=0$ it doesn't mean that the actor and the recipient do not share genes; it only says that the recipient carries the genes of the actor at the same frequency as the population.
Now let's re-introduce $b_i$. To simplify let's first consider the situation where $b_i = 0$: $E(qj) = b_{i,j} q_i + (1-b_{i,j}) q$ is just the translation of 'the gene frequency of the replica part is q_i' and 'the gene frequency of the non replica part is $q$'; because $b_{i,j}$ is the fraction of the replica part, ie the chances that our locus of interest belongs to the replica part of individual $i$ in individual $j$.

Do not stir. Gently rock the capped tube until the BSA has dissolved completely.
Set the pipette to 10 mL, pipette 10 mL into the vial and document the weight. Set the pipette to 5 mL, pipette 5 mL into the vial and document the weight.
So even if you set your pipette at 190 uL, you may still dispense a volume ranging from 187 to 193 uL.
Beavers cut small trees (5. For 462 trees, we measured the slope at the base of the tree, the orientation of the cut relative to this slope, the distance of the tree from the water, the radius of the tree, and the symmetry of the cut.
For example, you may mix 2 uL of your sample with 1 uL 6X loading dye and 3 uL water for a final volume of 6 uL.

If it is inconsistent (both under and over pipetting) then it's either technique or the pipette (bad/damaged pipettes can be inconsistent, poorly but good calibrated pipettes will more likely be consistent and only need calibrating).

One group expands, a lot of its elements fizzling out but some of them spawning their own subgroups that expand in turn while still being recognizably part of the original group, and so on so forth with the fizzling of the most and spawning of the few, at some point the older groups might be so large and full of different subgroups that they start losing their definition, and basically at some point you realize the whole big mass of elements that now cover the sky includes both A and B, meaning if you roll back the tape you can certainly track how something that looked like A changed over time into something that looked like B, but it's really a very small part of the whole show.

) However, while shared evolutionary history may explain why fish and whales have similarly placed flippers / pectoral fins, and why they both have a flexible spine that supports undulatory swimming with the help of a tail fin, it does not explain the convergent evolution of whales' forelimbs (which were formerly adapted for walking on land) into fin-like flippers.
The most likely explanation is that cetaceans evolved to exploit an unfilled ecological niche or adapted to new niches that formed as a result of plate tectonics or other types of environmental changes that occurred 50-55 million years ago.
) Some things that have been mentioned here, though true or possibly true, are not really relevant to the question: A limit on how much taller the father is than the mother for the typical child (imposed by female or male preference) does not change the answer to the main question (direction of mean height change, if any), only the speed ("in 'hundreds of years'").
On a personal note, I tend to avoid the term "race" as I prefer use the concepts of "ethnic groups" (when dealing with the arbitrary categorization of humans into groups), "subspecies" (when dealing with commonly agreed upon subspecies based on empirical data; there are no commonly agreed upon subspecies in humans), or "species" (when dealing with notion of reproductive isolation) instead so that my interlocutor has a better understanding of what I mean.
Feeling that we talk about improvement over another species I think that much of the issue in saying that the dog descend from the wolf is that some people would understand things like "dog is more evolved than the wolf", which makes no sense.
There would be several possible outcomes to these debates: 1) All of the new intermediate entities demonstrate that in the space of characteristics things can have, the old category as previously defined no longer forms a sharp cluster, but a sharp cluster still does exist that is pretty close to that old category; in that case the old category gets a new definition, and as a result some entities might change their classifications, or not.
I wanted to give special mention to resolution and darwin finches, darwin finches undergo different selection every year depending on rainfall, large and small (specialized) beaks during wet years and medium (generalist) beaks during dry years, this changes every breading season with the amount of rainfall on any large scale this would appear to be no change as they tend ot average out, but with better resolution we can see many many small directional selection pressures adding up to no net change on a large scale.

Are acid-fast mycobacteria "obstructing" alveoli or just colonizing? a) cell-mediated hypersensitivity b) obstruction of alveoli by large number of acid-fast mycobacteria I think the right answer is "obstruction of alveoli by large number of acid-fast mycobacteria", but I am not sure if you can say that acid-fast mycobacteria obstruct alveoli.
I'm familiar with monozygotic twin (MZ) discordance for AD and ASD and the methylome studies done in discordant MZ for those disorders.
Obstruction is possible, but M. Mycobacteria are on the order of 2µm in length and 0.
ROR1 and ROR2 are critical for developing tissues in the majority of cases. Examining the literature it'd seem that the ROR pathways incl.
They found a significant association between some phenotypes and ASD. They studied two groups of boys, 65 that had been diagnosed with ASD and 41 who had not.
We are all somewhere on this spectrum, but there is a threshold zone around where we cross from "normal" to "diagnosable as ASD".
Ror1 is a pseudokinase that is crucial for Met-driven tumorigenesis. In terms of ROR1 is tissue, abnormalities that lead to death were noted in newborn mice that has ROR1 knocked down (9).
Males are more likely to develop ASD, but affected females tend to be more severely impaired.
What exactly is the "interference" caused by the noninfectious mycobacteria ? I am unable to understand the relation between exposure to noninfectious mycobacteria and lessening of efficacy of BCG vacccine.
However it seems ASD is not a simple X-linked disorder. Then how is it possible males are more susceptible than females, if the causal genes are located in autosomes?

potential, ion, channel, membrane, action, sodium, na, voltage, current, potassium
And the Nernst potentials are (the differences between the K+ and the Na+'s Nernst potential and the membrane potential let the mechanism work): K+ = -74mV Na+ = 55mV Cl- = -60mV I am wondering if the membrane potential is 0mV, whether the K+ and Na+ Nernst potentials still cause the mechanism to work, so can 0mV be a reasonable value?
They are often referred to as inward/outward (negative/positive respectively) currents as well, due to the direction of the flow of ions.
My professor said that inward rectifying channels help move the membrane potential back to the resting potential during the undershoot phase of the action potential.
But as it pumps in 2 K+ for every 3+ Na+ moving out how can it make the membrane potential less negative when the net result is one positive charged ion moving out?
From what I understand, the resting membrane potential is at around $-60\rm\,mV$, close to the equilibrium potential for potassium (from the Nernst equation) because the permeability of potassium is much greater than that of sodium, even though the permeability is low.
As I understand it, ions flow down their electrochemical potentials through ion channels during a neuron's action potential.
So, while cells are in their resting membrane potential, the inward current of sodium is equal and opposite to the outward current of potassium.
My textbook says “Among K+, Na+ and Cl-, K+ contributes to the resting membrane potential the most, because it has the greatest permeability across the membrane.
In a typical neuron, during the rising phase of an action potential, the conductance of sodium compared to other ions is very large, large enough that you can almost ignore the other ions, so the peak of the action potential gets fairly close to the sodium reversal potential.
The fact that the sodium/potassium pump does not move an equal number of ions in each direction does not actually matter at all for resting membrane potential; the resting membrane potential would be almost the same if that wasn't true.

How is endogenous gluten released from fat? You have been 3 months in gluten free diet.
I've found that, over time, physical conditioning can reduce and/or eliminate the bruising to the point where even after hard impacts, there is no residual bruising.
That looks like a bit like a Smilax to me, possibly Smilax herbacea. For you, or for other Pennsylvania people, note that the Pennsylvania Flora Project of the Morris Aboretum is a great resource.
Gluten is a protein. But the carbon has no 'memory' of its previous role in a gluten molecule, and could not act as gluten when the fat is subsequently oxidized.

11$, which is twice as advantageous as the one reported for $lacA^{+}$ over $lacA^-$.
Also could you clarify what you mean by "analogue for glp-1"? It could be that for the particular expression levels you have in those cells, if the GLP-1 is over expressed or if its non-endogenous, it causes toxicity and kills the cells that are expressing it hence why you do not see any GLP-1 expression (e.

temperature, primer, heat, cold, degree, pcr, hot, tm, annealing, body
It is actually good if both the primers have the same Tm (Melting Temperature) because you would basically want both primers to anneal at your Ta (Annealing Temperature) which is generally set as Tm-5.
One with Tm 65 degree Celcius (Annealing at 65 degree Celcius) and another with 72 degree Celcius (Annealing at 72 degree Celcius).
Stallions/Geldings don't have nipples because a mares "udder" ,so to speak, is underneath her flank area.
When the surrounding temperature is below the body temperature, the body has a mechanism to heat up.
I am amplifying a gene where in a gradient pcr i am getting amplification at an annealing temperature about 5 degrees (67) higher than Tm (62.
You are right that the annealing temperature shouldn't be higher than the Tm of the primers.
According to my knowledge the main thing in annealing temperature in PCR Primers annealing temperature should be selected by keeping in 5° less than the lower melting temperature of primers Secondly MgCl2 working Concentration also plays a major role in PCR optimization
What happens if both the primers are having same Tm? One of the key rules in primer designing is that Tm (melting temperature) of forward and reverse primers should be in the range of ±5°C.
The melting temperature of these primers are 84. What annealing temperature should I use a h?
Regarding higher annealing temp than Tm, I often use T7 primer of which Tm is 48.

I have 6 genes of Candida albicans yeast namely orf19. 723 NONE orf19. 723 NONE orf19.
EPA: DHA: Fish oil contains high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 omega-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 omega-3), which are omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Cyanocobalamin has an $M_r$ of 1355, of which 26, or less than 2% ($CN^-$) is cyanide.
Therefore $$ a(S) = \frac{V_{max}\cdot [S]}{K_M + [S]} \cdot \Omega = \frac{V_{max}\cdot S / \Omega \cdot \Omega}{K_M + S / \Omega} = \frac{V_{max}\cdot S}{K_M + S/\Omega}.
and what about boilling or frying fish? and the other is Applying heat to omega-3 doesn't make omega-3 become any bad compound.
Only linoleic acid ($\omega 6$) and $\alpha$-linolenic acid ($\omega 3$) are essential.
I just find that this would be confusing in the case of benzodiazepines since they increase GABA activity, presumably also in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway thus producing dysphoria and not euphoria.
I have heard that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are a good way to prevent/reduce cholesterol problems.
So ORF number 1 comes earlier in the transcript, but ORF number 3 is longer .. I've a question about ORF and translation into protein.

crow, corvus, carrion, hooded, corvids, cornix, austria, tentatively, ornithologist, photographed
After looking through many images of various crow species and their hybrids, I've tentatively identified these as: Carrion crow (Corvus corone) Carrion crow × Hooded crow (Corvus corone × Corvus cornix) Carrion crow × Hooded crow (Corvus corone × Corvus cornix) I initially believed this to be a Hooded crow (Corvus cornix), but the broken coloration on the wings made me think it might actually be a hybrid as well.
A Hooded Crow Corvus cornix in the garden of Belvedere (Vienna). This does appear to be the hooded crow (Corvus cornix).
This one is a bit more difficult, but I think it is also a hooded crow or possibly a hybrid Carrion crow × Hooded crow (Corvus corone × Corvus cornix).
Recent research has indicated that wild American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) can recognize individual human faces (Mazluff et al.
My Theory Crows are very curious birds. First of all, this seems like a crow. Crows are very social birds, they live in flocks or murder.
We had in class following question which I had no idea how to get to the correct answer: The carrion crow and the hooded crow are fertile together, but their reproductive success is reduced by 50%.
Again, I'll call these birds "crows". Does the now adult crow think it's just an oversized sparrow?
In India it is also sometimes referred to as the common Indian crow, and in Australia as the Australian crow.
Or did the crow just opportunistically scavenge a dead bird? Here's a picture (by Rob Curtis) of a crow carrying and eating the corpse of what looks a bit like a small hawk or falcon: Other pictures clearly show the crow is eating the dead bird.
Would that attract the crows? Crows specifically are omnivorous and predatory in addition to being carrion scavengers.

paresthesia, torsion, gastropod, mollusc, sinistral, nickel, alloy, metal, cobalt, chromium
IARC groups nickel and cobalt metals in group 2B and chromium in group 3 (hexavalent chromium is group 1!).
The torsion evolved only once in the gastropods. Why so many molluscs exhibit sinistral winding?
Why are there no plants with metal thorns? No metal-plated sloths? No beetles with metal-tipped drills?
The same is true of cobalt and chromium alloys - they are chemically bonded to the other elements in the alloy, making a new molecule, and cannot "leach out" without the chemical bonds being broken, which cannot happen in the mouth or at standard cooking temperatures.
An alloy of those might be what you're looking for. but there is this that I found: Low Melting Fusible Alloys Both Cadmium and Lead are toxic, but Bismuth, Indium, and Tin are not.

Why do beta-carotene and other provitamins like alpha-carotene not cause vitamin-A toxicity but rather carotenosis (Orange skin) whereas retinal, retinol, and retinoic acid cause vitamin A toxicity with dosage as low as 4000 IU?
As I understood it the retinol just straightens out again. Retinol is stored in the liver from dietary intake, and then shipped via retinol binding proteins to the eye.
However, carbon and silicon are not completely interchangeable. The bond strength between carbon or silicon and itself is different, thus, some molecules with high chain length can not be replicated with silicone.

glucose, fruit, sugar, mm, insulin, fat, lipid, acid, fructose, glycogen
Why doesn’t the corpus luteum degenerate immediately after the LH surge, then, whereafter FSH and LH levels are so low?
Glycerol is not lipid (short chain polyol, so it is polar and water soluble), but fatty acids (amphiphilic) and triglycerides (hydrophobic) are.
Most of the fats in the diet are triglyceride and in hydrophilic environment they form globules.
Between these head groups facing the interior and exterior, the hydrophobic tail groups of opposing lipids associate with each other to create a hydrophobic core within the membrane.
Why would they be storing glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles like insulin?
Lipids can be amphipathic as you already know about fatty acids. They consist of saponifiable lipids, such as glycerides (fats and oils) and phospholipids, as well as nonsaponifiable lipids, principally steroids.
So what causes ribosomes to associate with the membrane of rough ER but not that of smooth ER.
In addition, glucose inhibited fructose uptake by 60% and likewise fructose inhibited glucose uptake by 40%.
When insulin levels are low the GLUT4 protein is in the membrane of small vesicles inside the cell.
neither hyperinsulinemia nor hyperglycemia can independently induce much net hepatic glucose uptake.

mhcii, pufas, mhci, xenon, oblong, hyaline, cell, ventilator, conidium, one
My question: the phrase "oblong to Allantoids"; Is the word oblong valid for this context?
How do cells know whether they should grow the hyaline cartilage? What are the key molecules that trigger the synthesis of hyaline cartilage?
Sure generally any cell that expresses MHCII will also express MHCI. The source of antigens (peptides here) and process for presenting them via MHCI and MHCII are somewhat different from one another.
Xenon. Negative points are high cost and the limited number of ventilators supplying Xenon.
PUFAs are used to create these. There are positive sides of the PUFAs when they are used in other way.
No, MHCII mismatch can also lead to transplant rejection, though through different mechanisms.
Hyaline cartilage has more matrix in comparison to elastic cartilage. There are three types of cartilage: hyaline, fibrous and elastic cartilage.
The presentation of antigens on the cell surface is done by two different molecule complexes: The MHCI and the MHCII complexes.
T helper cells with CD8 and MHCII complex recognise the virus and kill it. I think this is what is happening, for instance in HIV infection: where dendritic cell (ADCC) presentation of HIV infected CD4+ to MHCII and T helper cell T helper cell activates cytokine release Natural killer cells come and lyse the HIV infected CD4+ T lymphocyte
Other PUFAs are synthesized from these by desaturases (as Alan Boyd pointed out).

It's a larvae from a ladybird (or ladybug). The one you have photographed, and the one on flickr, are larval forms of the ladybug, just like when a catepillar becomes a butterfly, the ladybugs also have a larval stage in their life cycle which crawl around and look very different to the adult form.
Sinew: Includes both of the above. When I had my anatomy classes, sinews were regarded as an inclusive class, which included both ligaments and tendons.
Ladybug, left; masked chafer, right. pasadenae; Vail, AZ (source) When it flies, it opens up its wings like a ladybug's.
I also have aphids, spider mites, and psyllids on it, and am hoping it's a predator like a ladybug larva but the colours are wrong.
It also provides a moisturising effect on the itchy spot (reference). Salt is also known to provide relief to itching (reference) and the slight salt content of saliva helps in that respect too.
So sinew = tendon. Sinew is a bit more general and somewhat ambiguous. It is mostly used today synonymously with tendon, but historically it has been used to mean either tendons or ligaments, or even to mean muscle.

Lentiviruses have an overlap between gag and pol, and a gap between pol and env.
I am not very familiar with the relationship between retrovirus and lentiviruses.
Q3: how can an endogenous retrovirus disappear from a species? Q1: If someone in a species gets infected with an endogenous retrovirus, does that mean that absolutely all of their children will have that endogenous retrovirus?
None of them is integrase: P12497 Protein Gag-Pol polyprotein Gene gag-pol Organism Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group M subtype B (isolate NY5) (HIV-1) P14350 Protein Pro-Pol polyprotein Gene pol Organism Human spumaretrovirus (SFVcpz(hu)) (Human foamy virus) Even if you meant the integrase product of the polyprotein, the second one is not even HIV.
Endogenous Retroviruses and Human Evolution Otherwise I can recommend reading the article on "Endogeneous retroviruses" in the Wikipedia, it is pretty extensive and has a lot of references.
Since retroviruses evolve rapidly. I think this is why all synthetic retroviruses are continually renewed and host tissue discarded.
Should it not just be an endogenous retrovirus? (I am not a biology student, so I might not have understood the idea of a provirus/retrovirus entirely.)
However, lentivirus does not need to wait for cell division, because one of proteins in lentivirus binding to virus RNA genome has a nuclear transport signal.
I've already begun discussing the pathogenesis of the disorder, but I want to start making a connection between food and IBS.
Not only retroviruses do that. retrovirus but not only) to insert DNA segments into eukaryote genome.

In short, a mutation can refer to An event narrow sense broad sense An allele definition based on ancestral/derived states definition based on frequency Before going into the details of these definitions, it is important to first define a few other terms.
The basic steps of ChIP-Seq are: Crosslinking proteins to DNA - this fixes the proteins in their natural positions Nuclease digestion - this removes regions that are unbound to protein; nucleases are sterically hindered from digesting protein-bound DNA Immunoprecipitation - this allows isolation of the target protein by binding it to a selective antibody Sequencing to determine the bound DNA sequence Mapping the reads to the reference genome Why so many reads?
Convention for representing features in DNA sequences The convention is that in indicating any sequence feature† in a protein-coding gene on double-stranded DNA, a single strand‡ is represented — the one from which the amino sequence could be read using the genetic code (conceptually, with T substituted for U).
TO my knowledge, there is no theoretical way to predict the FRET efficiency based on linker sequence, and from scientists I've talked to, they conduct a trial-and-error approach using purified protein products to screen for an optimal length if it appears necessary to do so.
A 2012 review of metazoan promoters begins with the definition: “Gene promoters are the loci overlapping transcription start sites (TSSs), at which the total regulatory input of a gene is integrated into the rate of transcriptional initiation.
In this respect it's less a question of "why AUG" than "why this specific initiator tRNA", the answer being that it's got certain sequence elements and modifications that distinguish it from the elongating tRNAs which bind elongation factors and hence are targeted to the ribosomal A and B sites instead of the ribosomal P site (with function being dependent on form, basically it's shaped to set up transcription rather than to elongate an existing nascent chain polypeptide).
See this post for the definition For simplicity, above, I used the terms genetic diversity and genetic variance correctly but without highlighting that they take different definitions.

It's interesting that you are asking for the fraction of ligand bound to receptors ($[RL]/[L]_{tot}$).
When there is a mixture of multiple ligands and receptors where each ligand and each receptor can interact with eachother, this is not so simple.
Price, 1970; Price, 1972a), but most relevant for your question in probably Price (1972b).
9 and [RL] = 0. The Kd of the receptor-ligand interaction = 10^-8 mol l-1 Where Kd = ([R][L])/([RL]) I assume as a percentage I could state, [L] = 0.

So does the same thing happen when the ligand is not the endogenous neurotransmitter, but instead an "artificial" antagonist -- like, say, bupropion bound to a nicotinic receptor?
If this is the correct definition of a "ligand", then how can adrenaline be a ligand?
Once the receptors were tuned to have few very specific receptors and once they were tuned to have a lot of unspecific receptors.
Is it a direct physical result of the receptor-ligand complex being internalized?

What exactly are differences in HPLC and FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) instruments, and why would FPLC be a better technique than HPLC to use with proteins?
The only difference between FPLC and HPLC is the amount of pressure the pumps apply to the column.
The best way is to use FPLC if you know what kind of protein you're looking for.
The principal differences between electrophoresis and HPLC (chromatogrphy) are: HPLC relies on differential interaction of the molecules with the stationary phase (i.
This is a routine procedure in FPLC to prepare columns for storage. See this technical note: All SEC columns are delivered in 20% ethanol to prevent microbial growth.
Preferably they should be simple and fast, not something like a full FPLC/HPLC run.

Not all mutagens carcinogens. I'm no expert on the matter, but just quoting from Wikipedia: Mutagens are not necessarily carcinogens, and vice versa.
There are many substances listed as carcinogens bu IARC but they are not mutagenic.
How would we know if the carcinogen is a human carcinogen or not? I'm guessing that if a mutagen showed no growth without the rat liver extract, but then growth with the rat liver extract this would mean that it is a human carcinogen.
If the chemical is found to mutagenic in the Ames test then there is a good chance that it will be a carcinogen because of the link between mutagenesis and cancer.
If so, what kind of chemicals or physical mutagens (e.g. If a tautomeric shift can occur due to mutagenic activity, is it possible for the mutagen to undo and "correct" the mutation by reversing the shift?
Not all carcinogens are mutagens. Are there mutagens that just do not cause cancer?

meiosis, egg, secondary, oocyte, sperm, primary, ovum, division, ii, follicle
3 hrs before ovulation, the Pre ovulatory Follicle (with the secondary oocyte inside) is arrested in the metaphase of Meiosis II and is extruded out of the ovary - a process called as Ovulation.
After ovulation, each oocyte continues to metaphase of meiosis II. Which follicle is arrested in the metaphase II of oogenesis?
After ovulation, each oocyte continues to metaphase of meiosis II. An oocyte completes meiosis I as its follicle matures (during ovulation) resulting in a secondary oocyte and the FIRST polar body.
This is the first meiotic arrest. These secondary oocytes will then start the second meiotic division, but this second meiotic division is arrested as well.
So, the Graaf folicle, last stage of follicular development, has a secondary oocyte arrested in metafase II.
At the time of ovulation,secondary oocyte is arrested at Metaphase II and goes into the fallopian tube.
So female meiosis II must happen before the sperm fuses with the ovum. Sperm must ignite some process in female that puts female meiosis II going on before sperm can fuse with egg.
After reading this page I can say now that metaphase is the stage in which the second meiotic arrest occurs within oogenesis: The oocyte is arrested again in the metaphase of the second meiotic division.
As all of us know that in meiosis oocyte forms follicles and egg cells, so my question is that if an oocyte can form follicles then why sperm cells do not forms the follicles?
The primary oocytes continue the process of oogenesis after puberty begins. This process continues until puberty when there are only about 400,000 primordial follicles left in the ovaries.

O- should be the universal donor not O+because when rh- blood is given to rh+ person ,the rh+ person can not make antibodies against rh- blood because there are no rh antigens in the rh- blood.
If Rh- mother has Rh+ baby, the mother can become sensitized during first pregnancy and then if subsequent fetuses are also Rh+, there can be eryhtroblastosis foetalis.
The rhesus factor (the + / - part of the blood group) can cause complications with pregnancy under certain conditions and lead to the so called Rh disease: If the mother is rhesus negative and the father, rhesus positive; then the birth of a child with Rh+ blood group (inherited from the father) can cause the mother to build antibodies against this blood group.

Also if O is the universal donor, it should be O+ that is the universal donor and O- that isn't because Rh+ is compatible with Rh+ and Rh-, not just Rh+ or Rh-.
It's rare, but it can happen when an Rh+ baby is conceived by an Rh- mother. I have read about Rhesus D Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn, sometimes called "Rh disease".
Also, rhesus incompatibility during pregnancy is only a concern in second or subsequent pregnancies (or after miscarriages).
A hemolytic disease occurs for example when mother have Rh- and the unborn child have Rh+ after his father.
Today, about 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancy end in miscarriage. What was the percentage of pregnancy ending in miscarriage before modern medicine?
Rh antibodies are harmless until the mother's second or later pregnancies. You are talking about Rh Incompatibility, and can become a big issue when the mother has Rh(-) blood and the father has Rh(+) blood (such as the case with your cousin and his wife).
